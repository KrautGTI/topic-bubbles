However, the claimants did not accept the proposition, calling for a definitive judgment on the case.The court, which proceeded with the trial, sided with the claimants' view that Humira's dosing regimens were ""obvious"" or ""anticipated"" at the time that the two patents were filed, and thereby not subject to patent protection.AbbVie's composition patent on Humira is set to expire in Europe in 2018. However, the US pharmaceutical giant has been filing new patents over the drug's usage considerations to fend off biosimilars cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs until at least 2022.Humira is the world's best-selling drug for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, generating worldwide revenues of more than $14 billion for AbbVie in 2015.""We welcome the court's judgment. At Samsung Bioepis, we remain committed to driving positive change in the health care system through the development of affordable, high-quality biosimilars,"" Samsung Bioepis said in a statement.The UK ruling is expected to help speed up the release of Humira biosimilars particularly ones developed by Samsung Bioepis and FKB in the UK as well as across Europe.""AbbVie has been filing overlapping patents on Humira to extend its patent life,"" said Dongbu Securities analyst Koo Ja-yong, noting other biosimilar makers had lost their patents disputes over Humira in the US last year, dampening the sales outlook of Humira-referencing biosimilars.""However, Samsung Bioepis has successfully obtained a ruling that invalidates AbbVie's Humira indications. We expect this ruling to push forward the European launch of Humira biosimilars,"" Koo said.The UK court judge in charge of the case said that the ruling would serve a useful purpose in dispelling AbbVie's ""threats that it will enforce its patents against biosimilar competition anywhere in the world.""""The declarations will serve a useful purpose of dispelling commercial uncertainty in the UK (and European) market, which those threats have created,"" Justice Henry Carr wrote in his ruling.""It is reasonably foreseeable that the grant of the declarations will promote a settlement on a European or even a worldwide basis,"" he said, suggesting the ruling could impact future patent jurisdictions in neighboring countries.Samsung Bioepis' Humira-referencing biosimilar, SB5, was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency, the region's drug regulator, in July 2016.Once it obtains marketing authorization, SB5 would become the Korean drugmaker's third biosimilar to hit markets in Europe. The company already sells two biosimilars one referencing Enbrel and another referencing Remicade in Europe.In addition to Samsung Bioepis, global pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Novartis as well as Coherus Biosciences, FKB and others, are working to launch their own Humira-referencing biosimilars.In Amgen's case, it has already secured the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Amjevita, its Humira-referencing biosimilar. Yet the company most likely will not be able to commercialize Amjevita within this year, as AbbVie has filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement.By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PATENTS (93%); ARTHRITIS (92%); PATENT INFRINGEMENT (90%); PATENT LAW (90%); PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG & DEVICES LITIGATION (90%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (90%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (90%); RHEUMATIC DISEASES (89%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (89%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (89%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); SALES PROJECTIONS (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (78%); JUDGES (78%); PHARMACEUTICALS PATENTS (78%); SUITS & CLAIMS (73%); LITIGATION (73%); PSORIASIS (72%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); ABBVIE INC (90%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (57%); DONGBU SECURITIES CO LTD (51%)TICKER: ABBV (PAR) (90%); ABBV (NYSE) (90%); BIIB (NASDAQ) (57%); 016610 (KSE) (51%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (90%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (57%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (57%); NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE (51%); SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, & FLOTATION COMPANIES (51%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (88%); INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (56%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); EUROPE (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (72%)LOAD-DATE: March 27, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

As an International Baccalaureate World School, Dwight School Seoul provides international education based on the highest recognized academic standards and uses the IB curriculum to kindle every child's personal interests, helping students become inquisitive, informed, self-aware and ethical citizens. In the Primary Years Program, or PYP, for age 3 to grade five, teachers harness students' natural curiosity about the world for their academic experiences. Students get to choose topics they are passionate about and delve deeply into those topics. In the Middle Years Program, MYP, for grades six to 10, a student might partner with a medical researcher for a rare mentorship in the sciences or get one-on-one tutorials to help overcome a particular academic challenge. In the Diploma Program, DP, for grades 11 and 12, a student might volunteer in an orphanage in Nepal for a week for a project in sociology or develop and build a touchscreen remote control for a drone in product design.As a student grows up in the challenging, comprehensive IB program, proceeding from PYP to MYP to DP, teachers and mentors help students find their 'spark of geniusï'and that lights the way to developing the independence and critical thinking skills that are demanded in university and today's globally competitive workplace. The IB Diploma Program -- internationally known as the 'gold standardï'in university preparation -- is the only curriculum where students all around the world are measured with the same academic benchmarks. Graduates of the Diploma Program at Dwight School Seoul continue to outperform their peers around the world.

They thought about boycotting the hearings to protest Kim's appointment, but later decided to participate.Kim Boo-kyum, the nominee for interior minister, was grilled over his alleged academic plagiarism, which is one of five corrupt practices that are causes for disqualification according to President Moon Jae-in's earlier promise - tax evasion, evasion of military service, registration of a false residence, real estate speculation and academic plagiarism.He was questioned on an allegation of plagiarism in his master's thesis at Yonsei University in 1999. 'I'm sorry for causing a stir, but the allegation was cleared up when I ran in the Daegu mayoral election in 2014, as the school confirmed it was not plagiarism despite some technical errors on references,' he responded.It was also alleged that Kim did not report his family's wealth properly as a public official. Kim's wife was holding shares in her company worth 7.5 million won in 2006 but he did not report this. Kim said according to the related law, public officials are required to report stocks they hold worth over 10 million won, so her stocks were not subject to the report.Another allegation was that Kim's wife's company provided computers and communication supplies to schools and public institutions while Kim belonged to the Assembly's committees related to education and public administration. Kim claimed he did not exercise any influence to get favors for his wife's business.For culture, sports and tourism minister nominee Do Jong-hwan, his view on ancient history became a hot issue. Some historians and opposition lawmakers claimed he had a 'nationalistic' view different from the mainstream and was feared to carry out projects to distort ancient history.'I don't intend to push a specific historical view,' Do said.He was also grilled over frequent traffic violations - 62 over the last five years since he became a lawmaker. Do said most of the violations took place in June 2012 when his driver broke traffic rules on bus-only lanes on highways.It was also alleged the former poet bought farmland in 2005 but did not farm it and used the land as a yard for his house. It is illegal to use farmland for a different purpose, and is subject to up to three years in jail or 30 million won in fines.Do said he failed to check if the land had been registered for farming, saying he would soon take the proper measures.Kim Young-choon, the oceans and fisheries minister nominee, faced allegations that he had a job at a company in 2008 before he finished his term as a lawmaker. It is illegal for a lawmaker to hold another job without reporting it.The nominee explained that he actually started working for the company after the term ended but the company registered him as an employee before he started.It was also found that he received 5 million won in political funds from the now-defunct Samhwa Mutual Savings Bank Chairman Shin Sam-gil in 2004, and it was alleged that in exchange for the money, Shin sought the lawmaker's influence to prevent his company from going bankrupt.Kim replied that the bankruptcy crisis at savings banks took place in 2011, long after he received the money, and that he had no personal ties with Shin.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PLAGIARISM (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (90%); STUDENT MISCONDUCT (90%); SCHOOL CHEATING (90%); HISTORY (89%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (89%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (78%); FISHERIES (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); ELECTIONS (77%); CORRUPTION (75%); POLITICS (75%); TAX FRAUD (74%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (73%); MAYORS (72%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); TAX LAW (71%); REAL ESTATE (71%); BOYCOTTS (70%); ANCIENT HISTORY (63%); VEHICULAR OFFENSES (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%)CITY: TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)LOAD-DATE: June 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

If proven true, it would be the first proof that the legend of ??Inju?? -- the practice of burying people under a foundation stone in the hope that the structure would not crumble -- was actually true. ??In the past, a body of a child was recovered amid the relics of the Silla Kingdom at Gyeongju National Museum, but there was controversy over whether the child was actually sacrificed,?? said GNRICH chief Lee Jong-hun. ??But the bodies exhumed at this site were highly likely to have been buried after a ritual,?? he added, saying that the Inju legend might turn out to be true. But Choi Byung-hyun, a professor emeritus of archaeology at Soongsil University, told local media that it is too early to definitively say whether human sacrifices were carried out during the Silla period.However, he said that the practice of building a wall on a spot where humans were buried suggests that great effort went into building Wolseong.Records showed that there had been rumors about Inju in 1,343, during the Goryeo Kingdom. An archaeological dig on the moat of Wolseong Palace uncovered 5-to-10-centimeter-tall clay figurines shaped like a person wearing Persian garments and a turban. The figurines are believed to have also been buried around 1,500 years ago as an offering. Researchers said that the figurines appeared to be shaped after ??Sogdian?? -- people of an ancient Iranian civilization -- which would make them the oldest figurines of Sogdians found in Kora. Seven ??mokgan?? -- wooden pieces used for recording documents before paper was invented -- were also found on the moat. Officials said that the ancient documents provided evidence on when moats were used during the Silla period and how the central government of Silla had demanded the cooperation of influential people in other regions to conscript workers for construction.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARCHAEOLOGY (91%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (90%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (76%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%)LOAD-DATE: May 16, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

'Ministry of State Security' is plainly a euphemism to obscure the criminality of this group's horrifying misdeeds, having waged genocide and crimes against humanity against a captive population forced to worship and serve the Kim family dynasty as deity. Kim Won-hong's discharge isn't a surprise, though; both Kim Jong-un and his father have run State Security directly and, in light of the 30-something despot's record, he is not likely to entrust this department's leadership to any individual for very long. South Korea has a singular, constitutional mandate to aid these killers' victims, as Article 3 predicates, 'The territory of the Republic of Korea shall consist of the Korean Peninsula.' Heightening the moral and legal obligation to 'do something,' the greater number of those who've perished and are at present dying are being exterminated solely for in real or perceived ways favoring the South.A North Korean WCSGNK interviewed, who defected in 2010, put it this way: '... prisoners are those who are falsely accused because of the term 'South Korea.''In a 2007 analysis concentrated on the North's prison camps, Ahn Myong-chol -- a former guard -- when asked if the system was responsible for as many as 1 million deaths, replied that the estimate was 'too low.' Ahn, who once contributed to atrocities and admits he had no sympathy for prisoners owing to excessive indoctrination, stated, 'The purpose of the camps was to kill the prisoners. ... None of the prisoners in the camp survive. It is a killing field.ï'He was referring to the 'absolute control zones,ï'where the majority of slaves are held in conditions that meet the legal definition of 'genocideï'and 'crimes against humanityï'-- release is not an option. Former prisoners who have made it to South Korea or other countries are primarily from the 'comparatively small revolutionizing re-education zones,ï'as described in the evaluation commissioned by Christian Solidarity Worldwide; 'those sent to the absolute control zones are sent there permanently, to remain in the camps even after death.'During the 2013 UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's 'human rights situation,ï'Ahn testified: 'They (the prisoners) all told me that one night when they were in bed, suddenly (State Security Department agents) came to their house and they got arrested ... these people ... had no idea why they were there.'In 2014 the independent international law firm Hogan Lovells found that North Korea may be committing genocide against three distinct groups supposed to be protected by the 1948 UN Genocide Convention: North Korea's 'hostile classï'-- the most frequently targeted population for brutality within a caste system largely categorized by means of interrogating an individual's family background -- religious groups and Chinese-Korean children; uncounted thousands of repatriated refugeesï'babies have been viciously killed through infanticide and inhuman forced abortions.Regarding the North's treatment of religious groups, Ahn maintained in 2007 that, 'The treatment of Christians precisely fits the genocide definition. The genocide definition fits the policy towards Christians 100 percent.ï'Had my paternal grandparents not chosen to defect as refugees, my father's family -- being northerners from a religious background -- would all have died. An estimated one-third of North Korea's prisoners are children murderously maltreated pursuant to the North's barbaric and opprobrious policy of collective punishment 'eliminatingï'three generations. They and their family members have been and continue to be ferociously assaulted, subject to 'medicalï'experimentation and savage coercive abortions, raped and discarded, systematically starved, maimed, burned, made to do slave labor, tortured in diverse ways and both publicly and secretly executed. Article 8 of the Genocide Convention stipulates that where there is a genocide finding action 'appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocideï'is obligatory; yet the international community has -- commensurate to the emergency -- done little more than issue token denunciations amid political wrangling. Sanctions and seasonal reports alone -- while helpful -- cannot and have not saved a single life within the North's 'absolute control zone.'Then there's the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) norm, recognized at the 2005 UN World Summit, which solemnly endorses employing 'appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful meansï'to safeguard populations from 'genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanityï'-- all crimes the Kim family dynasty has and continues to commit. Tragically, the R2P principle has been selectively invoked and come to be associated with 'military adventurismï'-- obviously a distortion of the original stated pledge which calls for governments to exhaust all 'peacefulï'methods to halt atrocities first, not least considering credible risks of exacerbating the world's foremost humanitarian disasters if failing to tread circumspectly.At the UN hearing, Ahn Myong-chol bore witness that camp guards are commanded to 'eliminateï'all 'evidenceï'of mass atrocity when war or an invasion seems imminent. He testified, 'In case a war breaks out ... we are supposed to wipe out the prisoners. ... In each political prison camp there are tunnels. ... These tunnels were dug so that we can eliminate the inmates in the event that we had to erase any evidence of their existence. ... Every camp has artillery ... to annihilate all evidence should there be an attack or a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.'Hence, Thae Yong-ho's strong admonition against a surgical or pre-emptive strike on the North's nuclear facilities holds commensurate gravity for the most voiceless and at-risk populations within the North. Thae warned at a Jan. 25 press conference such a military attack by the US would 'only turn South Korea ... into ashes.'There's only one pathway to resolution.When asked by KBS on what can be done about the North's nuclear program, the former deputy ambassador of North Korea's London embassy said: 'Some people are now advocating for military options but I would say the military option should be the last and worst scenario. I think we have to reach the goal of elimination of Kim Jong-un peacefully by means of a people's uprising inside North Korea.ï'The solution to both the North's mass atrocities and the nuclear threat is to, as Thae urged, eliminate Kim Jong-un 'peacefully.ï'This can only be accomplished through the South's leadership.South Korea should initiate a robust program of conditional amnesty -- necessitating of would-be beneficiaries the cessation of all human rights violations and opposition to the person of Kim Jong-un -- and actively reach out to northerners, 'moving their heartsï'with an earnest appeal for reunification and genuine inter-Korean reconciliation which prioritizes the people and not the abominable 'Dear Young General.'By Robert Park Robert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience. -- Ed.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); PRISONERS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); CORRECTIONS (89%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (76%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (76%); HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW (74%); HUMAN RIGHTS (74%); GENOCIDE (69%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (86%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: December 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

The decision reflects the stance of the new government that the move should be separated from political considerations.Kang Kyung-wha, the foreign minister nominee, said Thursday that 'Humanitarian aid, the universal value of humanity, should be sought separately from political considerations.' A presidential aide mentioned later the remark was in tune with the Moon government.Kang Yeong-shik, chairman of the Korean Sharing Movement, said he will first discuss a quarantine project with the North in fighting malaria. The group has mainly worked on agricultural assistance and nutrition projects for North Korean children since 1996.'After the discussion, we plan to send supplies for prevention of the disease on approval from the unification ministry,' Kang said.The humanitarian aid group also seeks to visit the country along with lawmakers including Won Hye-young of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea and Chun Jung-bae of the minor opposition People's Party. Kang said it may be realized around June 10 at the earliest.The ministry is expected to approve other suspended requests made by multiple NGOs to communicate with the reclusive country.Over the last year, Seoul only approved the Eugene Bell Foundation Korea's delivery of medication for tuberculosis to North Korea.Eugene Bell is a foreign foundation but needed the government's approval as it had to send supplies procured in South Korea.It caused controversy as it was done while domestic civilian groups were banned from contact with the North, even to discuss humanitarian assistance.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (90%); APPROVALS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS (78%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (75%); POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (72%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (67%); MALARIA (64%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (63%); TUBERCULOSIS (62%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (97%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: May 28, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The Seoul Central District Court partially ruled in favor of five English teachers who had demanded equal severance pay from their employer, a private language education chain that refused to acknowledge them as regular employees. The group is made up of three US citizens, one South Korean and one Canadian. The staff will receive total compensation of 187 million won ($167,188), with each individual??s payment varying according to their duration of employment. According to court records, the lawsuit began in September 2015, following the termination of their contracts. Requests for severance pay, along with compensation for unrecovered annual leave and vacation were submitted, but were rejected by the institute.In court, the institute??s attorney emphasized that the teachers were hired under ??service contracts for instructors,?? which provide wages at an hourly rate and consider them privately contracted workers. The contracts did not stipulate basic or fixed pay and a guaranteed registration of social insurance programs. They also did not require them to pay earned income tax. The legal team stated that the requested employee benefits, such as pensions, were already included in the wage package. However, the court rejected such claims, stating that the terms of the contracts represented the employer-employee relationship. ??The contract terms on codes of conduct regarding termination of contract, probation, and workplace punctuality policies represent the nature of direct employment,?? showed court records. ??Thus, the contract should be viewed as an official labor contract.??The court also pointed out that the institute??s decision to manage the teachers by assigning designated textbooks and lessons shows the nature of the contracts. The institute also evaluated employee performances through CCTV footage. The legitimacy of the wage package was also questioned, with the court saying ??the contracts do not mention retirement pay or other employee benefits in any form.??By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EMPLOYMENT (95%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (91%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (91%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); LITIGATION (90%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (90%); SEVERANCE PAY (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); ETHICS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); HOLIDAY & VACATION LEAVE (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (78%); EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); EMPLOYEE LEAVE (78%); LABOR & EMPLOYMENT LAW (78%); TEXTBOOKS (73%); SUITS & CLAIMS (73%); TEACHER RECRUITMENT & HIRING (73%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (88%)LOAD-DATE: June 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Tokyo also just approved several social studies textbooks that claim Korea's easternmost islets belong to Japan.Hong has an uphill battle against liberal contenders, such as Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) who has had a long lead in opinion polls and Ahn Cheol-soo, who is nearing the nomination of the People's Party with pledges for sweeping reform. In the latest Gallup poll, Hong was way behind Moon, Ahn and other contenders from the DPK with support of a mere 4 percent.Hong's lack of popularity is not surprising, given that he represents the party of the ousted former President Park Geun-hye, who was arrested Friday on bribery and other charges only a few weeks after being removed from office by the Constitutional Court on March 10.The former ruling party's nomination of Hong shows that the LKP does not yet understand what the people want in their next president.After the corruption scandal, many people want their next president to be corruption-free, honest and open to communication. But it is questionable whether Hong fits these descriptions.The Supreme Court is reviewing his bribery case. Hong has sought to create a hard-line image by vowing to become a 'strongman.' But it is uncertain what exactly he means. Since it also means dictator, some voters may only be appalled by a candidate with such an outdated concept of leadership.Many were also repelled by the outspoken former prosecutor's baseless bribery allegations against Moon and his classless remarks about Moon's late friend, the former President Roh Moo-hyun. Hong said that he will commit suicide like Roh if he is found guilty by the highest court.It remains to be seen how much effect he will have in wooing voters and restoring the people's faith in rebuilding conservative politics.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); VOTERS & VOTING (89%); BRIBERY (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (88%); TEXTBOOKS (78%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (78%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (78%); CONSERVATISM (77%); DICTATORSHIPS (77%); LIBERALISM (77%); POLITICS (76%); POLLS & SURVEYS (76%); SUPREME COURTS (75%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (73%); ARRESTS (73%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (73%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (73%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (72%); SCANDALS (68%); PUBLIC PROSECUTORS (68%); SUICIDE (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: TOKYO, JAPAN (74%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: April 2, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Liberty Korea Party policy committee chief Rep. Lee Hyun-jae said.Claiming that the Democratic Party of Korea had in the past focused on the ??small personal flaws?? of previous administrations?? candidates, Lee said that his party will apply ??stricter and more exact standards?? than the ruling party. In announcing the direction his party will take in the upcoming hearings, Lee said that the party will ??actively refer?? to the ??five principles?? stated by the ruling Democratic Party of Korea. The Democratic Party previously stated that it would exclude individuals with suspected involvement in avoiding military service, real estate speculation, tax fraud, plagiarism and using false addresses for personal gains from public office. The first to go under parliamentary scrutiny will be prime ministerial candidate Lee Nak-yon, who the main opposition claims requires ??microscopic verification.??The ruling party has so far laid nearly a dozen allegations against Lee, a former four-term lawmaker and South Jeolla Province governor. The allegations include Lee??s son evading taxes and military service and Jeonnam Development Corp. purchasing his wife??s paintings at unfairly high prices. Lee??s wife Kim Sook-hee is an art teacher-turned-painter and the Jeonnam Development Corp. purchased two of her paintings in 2013 for 9 million won ($8,000). The main opposition has also raised issues against Kang Kyung-hwa, the senior policy adviser to the UN secretary-general tapped to lead Seoul??s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing her daughter??s nationality. Kang??s daughter was born in 1984 in the US and has since taken US nationality. When the daughter was at high school age, however, she was registered to an address she was not a resident of. Kang has since told reporters that the allegations are true and that she informed the presidential office on related issues before she was nominated. ??(The issues) were reported to Cheong Wa Dae during the candidate verification process,?? Kang told reporters in New York. She added that she will elaborate on related issues at her confirmation hearing. Regarding the news that her daughter has decided to drop her US citizenship, Kang said that she was not fully aware of the situation and that she needs to speak to her family. Kang??s husband, Yonsei University professor emeritus Lee Yill-byung, has been quoted by the local media as saying that he had spoken with his daughter and that she had decided to regain South Korea citizenship.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (90%); TAX FRAUD (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); CITIZENSHIP (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); TAX LAW (73%); SCHOOL CHEATING (73%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (73%); PRICES (72%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (71%); PLAGIARISM (70%); VISUAL ARTISTS (70%); TAXES & TAXATION (69%); REAL ESTATE (69%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (64%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (64%); UNITED NATIONS (63%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

This represents a considerable shift in the timeline when it comes to the theory of humanity's origins.Previously the oldest human skull fragments were estimated to be a little shy of 200,000 years old. Skull fragments from Omo-Kibish are believed to be 195,000 years old, while fossils found in Ethiopia and parts of East Africa are believed to be between 154,000 and 160,000 years old.With the official inclusion of the Moroccan fossils into the human family, the territory for where humans are believed to have gotten our start has dramatically expanded, too. We're no longer just from one neighborhood in East Africa.There's a growing consensus in the scientific community that early humans may have arisen in several regions across the continent at once, though it was a relatively small band that left East Africa 70,000 years ago that we owe special thanks to. Those were our ancestors.The Moroccan fossils have opened the door to the past in ways we didn't expect when we first began to study them nearly 60 years ago. When they were first discovered, they were strangers.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon looks pensive during a welcoming reception held at the official residence of Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se in Hannam-dong, Seoul, Friday. / YonhapBy Kim Hyo-jinBan Ki-moon had been touted as the savior for the scandal-ravaged country by many people until he returned home Jan. 12 after eight years as the U.N. secretary general.That was mainly because he had a unique selling point as a presidential contender.His biggest asset is lengthy experience as a successful career diplomat and the leader of the global body. People thought this would benefit the country if he becomes the next president.However, what has been happening since his return is embarrassing.He is struggling to impress voters amid criticism that he has few ideas about how to revive the country and has ambiguous stances on politically sensitive issues. Bribery allegations surrounding him and his relatives especially grabbed the people's attention.Since his return, the gap between Ban and frontrunner Moon Jae-in in opinion polls has widened.With a series of slip-ups while on hectic tours around the country, the gap further widened with Moon from 3.9 percentage points in the second week of January, to 6.3 percentage points in the third week, according to local pollster Realmeter.Commentators say Ban's ambiguous political perspective, presumably stemming from the established diplomat's experience, is working against him in the burgeoning presidential race.'Strategic ambiguity only works in diplomacy, not in domestic politics,' said Choi Chang-ryul, a professor of political science at Yongin University.'He needs to communicate his policy plans soon, or his potential to shake up the existing political arena could fizzle out.'Ban has touted the need for 'political reform' in a bid to present a contending slogan against Moon's 'change of government' but he did not go into detail.His ambiguous political orientation makes it harder for voters to understand his philosophy, political analyst Hwang Tae-soon said.Ban has wavered between the liberal and conservative bastions in what is seen as a move to appeal to voters across the political spectrum. He visited the May 18 National Cemetery in Gwangju and the fire-ravaged market in Daegu on the same day.'The move, despite being devised in line with his much-touted 'grand integration' of the country, made him look like someone who is ill-prepared for politics or lacking his own perspective,' Hwang said.Comfort women dealBan has been particularly grilled for changing his position on a deal Seoul struck with Japan in December 2015 to settle issues related to Korean women forced into sexual service for Japanese soldiers during World War II.He expressed his support for the deal during a phone call with President Park Geun-hye on New Year's Day 2016, praising it as Park's 'courageous decision' and a 'move history will highly value.'But during an interview on the way home in early January, he criticized the deal, saying, 'If the 1 billion yen provided based on the deal has to do with removing a comfort woman statue, it is wrong.'Now he views the deal as helping Korea and Japan resolve their differences.'The deal has paved the way for a resolution of the decades-long conflict if not to the extent that the comfort women's deep sorrow was resolved,' he told reporters, Wednesday. 'But don't get me wrong that I see the issue has been completely resolved.'The comfort women deal, under which Tokyo provided 1 billion yen ($8.29 million) for the establishment of a foundation supporting the victims, has been under criticism from the liberal bloc as Seoul agreed to end the dispute once and for all without consulting the handful of surviving victims.In the face of reporters' repeated questions over his opinion on the deal, Ban bristled at them, putting himself in the middle of the controversy.A conversation between Ban and Lee Do-woon, his spokesperson, was overheard in which he said, 'They harass me with this single issue, making me look as if I made some historic mistake. They are bad guys.'Over the alleged gaffe, Chung Doo-un, a former Saenuri Party lawmaker, called Ban too 'immature' while he is angling for the country's top elected office.THAADWhile taking flak for vagueness in policy ideas, Ban has comparatively been vocal about security concerns.He threw full support for the planned deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery here, saying, 'The Korean Peninsula is in a quasi-war state so it was appropriate for the government to opt for the THAAD deployment.'The former U.N. chief called for better attention to North Korea's military threats, noting its latest move to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile.'Its aim is pure defense, not an attack, from the North's ballistic missiles and nuclear development,' he said during a lecture at Chosun University, Wednesday.'Once we slip in security matters, it's irreversible. As a security expert myself, I believe if we fail to manage it within the Korean Peninsula, it could lead to a regional and even an international conflict.'The controversy over THAAD has been ongoing for some time as liberal parties and heavyweights raised questions about its efficacy in fending off the North's missiles, and concerns about China's retaliatory actions to protest its deployment on the Korean Peninsula.China has strong objections to the plan based on the belief that the system's X-band radar could be used to spy on the country's military activities and capabilities. It has taken various retaliatory actions including banning K-pop and K-drama stars and reducing bilateral exchange and cooperation.Ban showed confidence in soothing rising tensions with China, saying 'It can be sorted out through diplomacy.'Job policyWhile Moon has pledged sweeping chaebol reforms with a special focus on Korea's top 10 conglomerates, Ban showed determination to resolve the high youth unemployment rate as a way to boost the slumping economy.Urging young people to pursue business startups for their part, he said he will come up with support policies and set up a government bureau specializing in youth employment.As a way to increase job opportunities, Ban presented ideas such as increasing intern positions and academic-industrial collaboration projects in consultation with firms, and backing overseas activities.The political newcomer, however, fell short of providing details for the vision. He was again embroiled in controversy by saying, 'Young people should buckle down' in the context of encouraging them to create employment chances on their own.Netizens bombarded Ban with criticism for making an out-of-touch remark and suggesting an increase in internships, accusing him of having little understanding of structural issues in the economy.Meanwhile, Moon revealed his job policy with a pledge to create 1.31 million jobs. He said the goal will be achieved by increasing the number of employees in the public sector and reducing employees' work hours.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (89%); VOTERS & VOTING (89%); POLITICS (89%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (89%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (86%); SCANDALS (77%); CONSERVATISM (73%); LIBERALISM (73%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (70%); POLLS & SURVEYS (69%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (64%); WORLD WAR II (60%); BRIBERY (53%)PERSON: BAN KI-MOON (93%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%); MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); KWANGJU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (51%); TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (50%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 23, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

"22","[Megan McArdle] The NFL canâ€™t afford to become a battleground",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Megan McArdle] The NFL canâ€™t afford to become a battleground   THE KOREA HERALD September 27, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 27, 2017 Wednesday[Megan McArdle] The NFL canâ€™t afford to become a battleground LENGTH: 1196 wordsIf you want a perfect metaphor for our national moment, it's Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva coming out onto the field for the national anthem while the rest of his team stayed in the locker room.Asked about it after the game, coach Mike Tomlin simply referred to an earlier statement on the reasoning for keeping the team in the locker room while the Star Spangled Banner played: he wanted the team to be unified in whatever it chose to do. 'People shouldn't have to choose,' Tomlin said. 'If a guy wants to go about his normal business and participate in the anthem, he shouldn't be forced to choose sides. If a guy feels the need to do something, he shouldn't be separated from his teammate who chooses not to.' But as Villanueva seems to have recognized, staying in the locker room is not simply a neutral act; it is also a choice, of tribal loyalties over national ones.Team unity is an admirable goal for a coach. But to secure that unity, he asked Villanueva, a West Pointer who served in Afghanistan, to refrain from publicly honoring a symbol of the larger team we're all supposed to be a part of: the United States. The coach asked him to choose tribal unity over the national kind. It's a false choice, but one that a lot of people are nonetheless being forced to make. And no matter what they choose, a lot of people end up angry.Tomlin himself, of course, was clearly in a bad position. And I have sympathy for the players who put him there. I understand why people with a platform would want to use it to publicly express the feeling that a lot of black Americans have: that their country does not treat them as completely equal citizens, but as a caste apart.Feeling like a citizen is more than being entitled to carry the passport abroad. If you are regularly stopped by police, demanding to know who you are and what you're doing here, you are apt to feel like exiles in your own country. People who feel this way could view the country's anthem as something less than a sacred expression of an inviolable national unity. Or perhaps they see it as embodying that ideal, of which our nation is falling short.A lot of people don't see it that way, however. Players refusing to offer a small symbolic honor to the country that has made them among the richest and most revered people in the history of humanity ... well, to many ordinary fans who cannot dream of such status or wealth, it seems frankly ungrateful, and disrespectful to the legions of less exalted Americans who ultimately pay their salaries.President Donald Trump was happy to capitalize on this also-understandable sentiment. In a series of tweets this weekend, he called for the players who won't honor the anthem to be suspended or fired. Given what the players were protesting, such an attack inevitably has its own tribal overtones.Trump was wrong to attack the NFL players; it is beneath the dignity of the US presidency to bully individuals or groups. (Exceptions made for political figures who have volunteered for the fray.) It's understandable that NFL players wanted to make as strong a counterattack as possible. Unfortunately, huddling in a locker room is not a very effective method of striking back at the president. If it was supposed to defuse the tension, it didn't. Trump's base is fired up over this conflict, their sympathies entirely with the president. And the mushy middle that such protests need to persuade are unlikely to be swayed by a refusal to honor the anthem.To get those people on your side, you first need a common connection, a claim on their sympathy and support. Where does that claim come from? Appeals to universal moral values like justice and equality may feel more important, more virtuous, than mere patriotic symbolism. But the historical record indicates that however much people honor those virtues in theory, in practice they are unwilling to actually do much to secure justice and equality for distant strangers. No, to really move people to action you need a more primal, less abstract connection, which is to say, precisely the sort of sentiments of loyalty and solidarity that the anthem evokes.Without them, we find ourselves where we are now: tribe against tribe, lofty ideals against gut patriotism. It's a battle that both sides are losing, at immense cost.The NFL can ill afford to become our national metaphor for this psychological civil war. There has been a lot of talk in recent months about how the protests are killing the NFL, a claim that is wildly overblown. What is true, however, is that the NFL is vulnerable to a killing blow. The news about football-related brain injuries seems to get worse every day. That will raise ongoing liability concerns, for professional leagues as well as the youth sports that ultimately create NFL players. It also creates parental concerns that could prove an even bigger problem for recruitment a decade or two from now. And if it's true that sports fandom is apt to start with playing that sport as a child, declining youth participation will ultimately cost the NFL viewers as well as great players.Nor is that the only problem that the NFL faces. Cord-cutting and the proliferation of alternative entertainments is eroding viewership, which means they certainly can't afford to lose any more fans. And team moves have left some teams with empty stadiums, which is dismal for the players and a very bad look if you're trying to woo viewers back.During the first few weeks of the season, viewership has been bad enough to get Wall Street worried about broadcasting stocks. But while the broadcasters will take the first hit, ultimately that money will come out of the pocket of the NFL, when contracts expire and the league can't get so much money for those precious viewing rights. Playersï'salaries -- and the visibility their protest relies on -- will fall.This is the worst possible time to be facing boycotts from both supporters of protesters like Colin Kaepernick and their detractors. Fandom is ultimately driven by that same wordless gut loyalty that animates the furor over those protests. To endure, that loyalty has to feel reciprocal. If the players signal they don't feel that loyalty, to one side or the other, they're apt to lose those people as fans. And they will have a heck of a time wooing those folks back.So while the protests are not, by themselves, going to kill football, they could be the catalyst that causes an underlying disease to flare into an acute crisis, much as Trump's election caused a low-level national culture war to flare into an epic struggle of rage and will. Which is why this is such a perfect metaphor. All Americans are facing the same choices Villanueva made: whether to stand for country or tribe. We may also face the choice a lot of other players made: which tribe to choose when country fails us. And unless we choose wisely, we may find that we have destroyed or impoverished the very thing we were trying to stand for.By Megan McArdle Megan McArdle is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: AMERICAN FOOTBALL (90%); SPORTS (90%); ATHLETES (68%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (65%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (60%); WAGES & SALARIES (60%)ORGANIZATION: PITTSBURGH STEELERS (84%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (50%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (93%); AFGHANISTAN (55%)LOAD-DATE: September 28, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Suh has been listed in Marquis Who's Who, the directory of biographies of people who have proven to be of significant value to society. She was selected for the award in June.A graduate of Seoul National University, Suh studied at the University of Kansas and has taught ceramic art at the College of Art and Design of Konkuk University from 1978 until she retired and became professor emeritus in 2013.At her studio in eastern Seoul, a handful of ceramic sculptures portraying biblical figures such as Ruth, Boaz and Obed and important events in the Bible are on display.""People might immediately think of bowls and vases when they think of ceramics, but I am more interested in abstract sculptures,"" Suh said during an interview with The Korea Times, Monday. ""For me, all shapes should include meaning. So I turned to the stories of the Bible and have interpreted them in my unique sculptural style.""She uses slicing, an unusual way to create ceramic sculpture. ""Traditionally, Koreans made pottery by throwing clay on the wheel. However, I use wire cutters to shape the wedging and bake the sliced pottery.""American art critic Jim Leedy said Suh has combined her dream of creating a glorious symbolic religious statement with the innovative use of the profound literal geometric power of nature to create a potent body of abstract work.Her sculptures are in abstract form and she said some people ask whether she has seen the biblical characters and do they look like this.""Of course I haven't seen Ruth or her mother-in-law Naomi. This is my interpretation of Ruth, who went through hardships but was loyal to Naomi. I tried to contrast the tough times and her affluent life that came later,"" Suh said.Currently, she runs the Bible House of Ceramic Art at a private apartment near Konkuk University, showcasing some of her major ceramic sculptures. However, her dream is much bigger.""If I sell my artworks to private collectors, it is no longer accessible to the public. If I donate these to a museum, they could be exhibited, but would spend most of the time in storage. So I want to open a permanent exhibition hall to display my sculptures where anyone can come see the works with an oratory in a pottery studio,"" Suh said.

"24","[Herald Interview] ?Creative industries spur cycle of innovation?",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Herald Interview] ?Creative industries spur cycle of innovation?   THE KOREA HERALD June 22, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 22, 2017 Thursday[Herald Interview] ?Creative industries spur cycle of innovation? LENGTH: 1159 wordsThe National Theatre of Great Britain in London -- one of the United Kingdom??s most prominent, publicly funded performing arts venues -- is a seedbed of artistic expression and commercial innovation producing world-class plays.Established in 1963 as the National Theatre Company, the organization has thrust Britain??s cultural prowess onto the world stage with imaginative interpretation of classical and contemporary performances. Some of its finest productions have been played in London??s West End theaters as well as New York??s Broadway theaters.Since 2010, its revenue from fundraising has increased 17 percent, while reliance on public funding has decreased by 25 percent.According to Martin Fryer, director of the British Council Korea, the creative industries -- encompassing cinema, performing arts, film, television, advertising, publishing, architecture, art, animation, gaming, crafts, design, fashion and music, among others -- not only give a lift to a country??s cultural riches, they also spur new formulas for the creative economy. The council is the UK??s international organization committed to strengthening cultural relations and providing educational opportunities, with branches in over 100 countries around the world and six continents. The UK??s creative industries have been one of the fastest growing sectors on the back of strong public support, government funding and entrepreneurial know-how.??Running a successful cultural industries sector requires a combination of passion and love for the arts as well as the practical tools of managing finances,?? Fryer said in an interview. ??As the sector grows, the appetite for cultural activities from communities grows. To cover insufficient money coming from the public purse, entrepreneurialism is encouraged. That brings in more professionals who do the training and develop business strategies.??Moreover, institutions adapt to increase fundraising from companies and foundations, which ??want to be part of this activity,?? the director explicated. ??You need the skills to attract these agencies.?? The new administration of President Moon Jae-in has vowed to upend corrupt practices that pervaded Korea??s art and cultural realm, as the previous government was found and condemned for creating a ??blacklist?? of anti-government artists, scholars and figures.With the appointment of the new Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Do Jong-hwan, the government is expected to put balm on the wounds and usher in fairness and rectitude into its cultural administration through diverse policy, financial and spatial support. This year has been designated the year for UK-Korea Creative Futures, with celebrations of various cultural and artistic activities in both countries. The events center on the five themes of intercity cooperation, innovation through digital technologies, diversity and inclusion, creative entrepreneurship and creative learning.The UK and Korea should build on the work by the previous government in the creative industries, Fryer said, pointing to the annual UK-ROK Creative Industries Forum between Britain??s Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Korea??s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. ??We hope that the new administration will review this bilateral cooperation forum to examine how both countries can use the creative industries to drive innovation in cinema, television, pop music, animation, gaming, visual effects and others,?? Fryer said. Fryer made a distinction between the profit-generating creative industries and grants-based arts and culture, noting the two realms overlap. Although universities, theaters, concert halls and multidisciplinary cultural centers receive small-scale grants from the British government, the financial support still helps their activities significantly by giving them room to experiment and take risks, he expounded. ??In the arts, experimentation and risk-taking are essential to create something new and exciting. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn??t,?? he said. ??The industry also needs well-designed regulations on tax breaks for sponsors and intellectual properties.?? Through wide-ranging schemes and fellowships, the UK government helps nurture next generations of museum and theatre directors and administrators, he said. By joining apprenticeship programs for six months or more, where they interact with mentors and gain hands-on experience, up-and-coming artists and administrators acquire the necessary skills on the field.Regarding the ??Hallyu Korean Wave boom,?? Fryer said its next challenge is to break down barriers and categories to spur creative convergence and coalescence of the crowds. ??You need to break down the categories and boundaries, such as pop, jazz and classical. They have different audiences and it??s almost tribal, but the truth is you can like both pop and classical at the same time,?? according to Fryer. ??For example, the classical music industry can attract young audiences by inviting pop artists as part of its program. But it has to be a genuine crossover and fusion, blurring the boundaries between entertainment and art.??Fryer pointed to newly adapted Shakespearean plays as a successful example. People might find Shakespearean plays ??serious, dull and boring,?? but they can be highly entertaining and popular if done with good production, design and other technological innovations, he said. Highlighting Britain??s complex history of colonization -- the nation being both colonized by Celts, Germans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and Normans, as well as a colonizer the world over through the British Empire -- Fryer said its global vestiges have enriched the nation??s culture and the arts. ??The modern Britain is benefitting from voices that have joined our world from our former colonies,?? he noted, pointing to artists and writers who trace their roots to the old empire, including South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa.??They grew up with the voices of their parents from these countries, and now they are speaking out with their own voices as second, third and fourth generations. They now have their own perspectives on our postcolonial cultural mix. And people are learning from each other.??However, in Korea the main thread of art and culture remains nationalistic and homogenous, Fryer said. ??There aren??t yet strong expressions of diverse, pluralistic identities representing different communities,?? according to the director. ??But as people from around the world make Korea their home and integrate into the society, more voices will come through. It??s almost inevitable.?? The newcomers will likely draw their inspirations from being an outsider, with many narrating their coming-of-age in multiethnic communities in Ansan and other outskirts of cities, Fryer forecast. ??The stories of their difficult journey to Korea and struggle to fit into the society will be very interesting.??By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS (90%); THEATER & DRAMA (90%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (89%); FUNDRAISING (89%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (78%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (78%); FILM (78%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (78%); ARCHITECTURE (78%); THEATER COMPANIES (78%); COMPANY STRATEGY (77%); ANIMATION (77%); INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (75%); BROADCAST ADVERTISING (72%); APPOINTMENTS (70%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (68%); THEATER (58%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (55%); TELEVISION ADVERTISING (54%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (54%); CORRUPTION (50%)ORGANIZATION: BRITISH COUNCIL (56%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (94%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (97%)LOAD-DATE: June 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"25","The time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","The time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine   THE KOREA HERALD December 18, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 18, 2017 MondayThe time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine LENGTH: 1590 wordsThis article was contributed by the Embassy of Ukraine. - Ed.What do Koreans know about Ukraine? Perhaps, some still remember a breathtaking triumph of a Ukrainian athlete Sehii Bubka at 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Those into football probably know Andrii Shevchenko, a 'Golden Ball' winner and legendary striker for Milan and Chelsea. Some Koreans probably think of Ukraine as a mysterious country in Europe, with the most beautiful women in the world. Of course, there is a lot more to Ukraine waiting for Korean people to discover. Take, for example, Ukrainiansï'constant aspirations to reach far beyond Earth. Starting with George Gamow, born in Odesa, who proposed a physical model of the Universe origins known as the 'Big Bang,ï'and continuing with a first turbo-jet engine that was developed by a Ukrainian scientist Arkhip Lyulka from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Ukraine has always been at the forefront of the world's most cutting-edge airplane and space program efforts. Everyone in the world knows about a titanic Antonovâ€‘225 Mriya airplane, originally developed for the space program. The airplane can lift record-breaking 253,800 kg and is nowadays used for super heavy cargo transportation.Another Ukrainian who truly deserves recognition as a front-runner of human space exploration is Sergei Korolev. Born and grew up in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, Korolev is sometimes referred to as the 'father of modern astronautics.ï'He engineered and made possible the launch of the first satellite Sputnik, as well as the first human being in space.Down on Earth, Ukrainians worked hard to advance humanity into technological era. Numerous fundamental discoveries in physics, mathematics, medicine, electronics have been made by Ukrainian scientists. Ukrainians have pioneered in computers industry, both hardware and software. MESM, the first computer in Europe, was built in Kyiv in 1948. As computers became more popular, Ukrainians made technology more accessible for people. For example, Ukrainian company PocketBook is one of the world's largest manufacturers of electronic readers based on the E Ink ('electronic paper') technology. World-famous software companies, such as PayPal and WhatsApp, and many others, have Ukraine-born founders.But what if we turn around, and explore what does an average Ukrainian know about Korea? One of Four Asian Tigers, the Miracle on Han River, the home of world-famous innovators such as Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and global events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics 2018. Perhaps, considering that Ukraine's national football team did not qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup, many Ukrainians will cheer for the Korean national team. Ukrainians welcome and enjoy Korean traditional culture, its food, music, fashion and architecture. Popular Korean restaurants in Kyiv serve authentic Korean food and drinks. K-Pop stars visit Kyiv for concerts, gathering huge crowds. Ukrainian TV channels broadcast Korean drama for Ukraine's 45 million strong audience. Kyiv residents spend their weekends at a recently opened Korean traditional garden, immersing themselves into a Korean spirit.Ukrainians know that the advances of Korean society are hard-earned. Thanks to the unbreakable spirit of the Korean people, the country could fight Japanese occupation and communists, rising from the ashes of Korean War into one of the most developed countries in the world. Ukrainian people can relate to Korea, because they also suffered from occupation by its powerful neighbor. Korean media have echoed the news from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. The government of the Republic of Korea expressed serious concerns over these developments in Ukraine, and stated that Korea will not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea (2014.03.19 MOFA Spokesperson's Statement on the Situation in Ukraine).Clearly, in the age of information technology warfare, the so-called 'hybrid wars,ï'it requires insurmountable amount of efforts and collective stand up to the aggressor. Take, for example, the spread of 'fake news.'Everybody knows that Yuzhnoye design office and Yuzhmash, world's leading manufacturers of space rockets, are in a full compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. The companies have a long standing and well-documented history of directly supporting the US government efforts in non-proliferation since the 90's. Also, the European Vega light-class launch vehicle was made in Ukraine, and was successfully launched from the Kourou Space Centre (French Guiana) on Aug. 2 delivering two satellites for the Israel Aerospace Industries into orbits. Since the Vega program began, Ukraine has helped deliver 25 satellites into space, for 19 customers. In fact, just on Nov. 12, Yuzhnoye and Yuzhmash helped launch a modernized launcher 'Antaresï'from the Space Flight Facility on the Wallops Island, Virginia, successfully delivering cargo to the International Space Station. Twenty-five years ago, in 1992, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea was opened in Kyiv. Soon after, the Embassy of Ukraine began its activities in Seoul. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our states, we have made considerable efforts to build deep cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Air and SpaceAs already mentioned, Ukraine is famous for its aerospace engineering industry, as it possesses a full cycle of aerospace hardware engineering and production. At the same time, Korea aspires to become a space nation, and recently succeeded in its advance into space. In fact, Korea Aerospace Research Institute and Yuzhnoye design office have already cooperated on the launch services: From 2013-2015, Dnepr rockets successfully delivered Korean satellites to orbit. Another legendary Ukrainian airspace company is Antonov. The company has designed over 100 passenger, cargo and special purpose airplanes, with over 22,000 of them used by 55 countries around the world. With more than 70 years of experience in airplane design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and even operation, it is ready to work with Korean partners to open a new era in aviation. Co-developing a brand-new NATO-compliant An-148 marine patrol airplane, and even delivery of super large cargo using record-breaking An-124 'Ruslanï'and An-225 'Mriyaï'-- all of these opportunities are fully available to Korea. In addition, in order to fully replace Russia-produced parts of its An-148, An-158, An-132 and An-70 airplanes, Antonov is open to consider Korean-manufactured parts and systems for its products.For over 70 years Ivchenko-Progress design bureau is developing and manufacturing aviation gas turbine engines for a wide range of purposes and applications, such as ground use or aviation. The scientific and technical potential and experimental research complex of Ivchenko-Progress SE allows developing turbo-jet engines of various types with a thrust of 500-50,000 kilonewtons and a power of 300-15,000 horsepower. The company is open to cooperation with Korean partners who are interested in turbine engines. AgricultureUkraine has long been called the 'breadbasket of Europeï'for its fertile black soil, perfect climate and landscapes for agriculture. Korean companies are actively participating in development of Ukraine's agricultural potential. For example, Posco Daewoo and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food will jointly upgrade agricultural machines in Ukraine for small and medium farms. The company will also construct grain elevators in Ukrainian ports, as grain exports continue to be a very popular commodity in international markets. The potential of Ukraine's agriculture, however, is far from being fulfilled, so Korean agritech and agriculture companies are more than welcome to explore possibilities in Ukraine and take advantage of world's most fertile soils.TechnologyKorean companies are successfully developing and selling their products in Ukraine. For example, Samsung Electronics operates an R&D center that employs more than 1,000 Ukrainians. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a leading software engineering country, with total market value over $2 billion. Ukrainian software engineers are among the best in the world. This year, Korean National IT Promotion Agency selected Ukrainian-founded Cards out of over 1,500 worldwide for 'K-Startup Grand Challenge 2017,ï'a governmental support program. Cards is developing 'andCards,ï'a software service that helps foster networking culture and build community at coworking centers.The time has never been better to invest into Ukraine, and to cooperate with the Ukrainian companies. Asian investors have already been actively investing into Ukraine. For example, Japanese electric equipment manufacturer Fujikura is already opening its second factory in Ukraine. Chinese construction companies are building ports and metro lines all around Ukraine. Various Chinese companies already invested over $7 billion into Ukraine. Tempered by the past, both Korea and Ukraine are emerging as a new type of nations: more united, competitive and creative. Passionate about technology, and rooted into tradition, both countries can combine their best achievements of past and present to reach extraordinary heights. The time has come for Korean businesses and investments to come to Ukraine, to work with Ukraine, and to create new growth engines between our countries.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); OLYMPICS (90%); SPACE EXPLORATION (90%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (89%); SOCCER (89%); SPORTS AWARDS (89%); COMPUTER EQUIPMENT (86%); SPORTS & RECREATION (83%); SUMMER OLYMPICS (77%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (77%); ASTRONOMY & SPACE (75%); AEROSPACE RESEARCH (73%); SPACE INDUSTRY (72%); 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS (72%); WINTER SPORTS (72%); ELECTRONICS (68%); SOFTWARE MAKERS (67%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (67%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (61%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (60%); RESTAURANTS (60%); POP & ROCK (60%); FIFA WORLD CUP (60%); WINTER OLYMPICS (57%)COMPANY: PAYPAL INC (52%)INDUSTRY: NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE & CLEARINGHOUSE ACTIVITIES (52%); SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES (52%); SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC (52%)CITY: KIYEV, UKRAINE (92%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); ODESSA, UKRAINE (79%)STATE: EARTH (79%)COUNTRY: UKRAINE (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); EUROPE (90%)LOAD-DATE: December 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Others argue it is unpleasant to the eye and the nose, taking up too much space.The 17-meter-tall and 100-meter-long installation, designed by environmental artist Hwang Ji-hae, is made up of countless used shoes, the source of the controversy.'Very impressive,' remarked Peter Ford, 32, a journalist from London roaming around the city before catching his connecting flight. 'It's like a huge waterfall of old shoes. The trees planted among the shoes also seem to symbolize new life coming out from the old.'Another passerby appreciated the large scale of the installation. 'It's a new and bold effort, especially for a Korean artist to make something so big,' said Kim Ji-kyung, 43, a sound architect.Cha Hyun-jung, 23, who was taking pictures of Shoes Tree just outside of the subway station, said, 'I think it's wonderful. Just the fact it's made up of old shoes makes it cool.'Some others expressed discomfort at the sight, including Baek Seung-cheol, 28, who studied architecture. 'I graduated from an art school, but it's unsettling. It's somewhat grotesque,' Baek said.Another artist, 67, also feels the artist has gone too far. 'I'm very disappointed. What a waste of money. It looks worse than what I saw on the news,' she remarked, staring at the installation and shaking her head sideways in disapproval.The city reportedly spent over 100 million won ($89,246) on the project.'I get the message, but I work here and it smells. I don't think it's good for the environment either,' said Kim Bo-kyung, 39, as she walked into a building next to the work.In response to mounting criticism, the artist held a press briefing at City Hall, Wednesday.While she is'grateful for all the attention,' the piece 'is still in the process of being installed.' She asked for more patience and wished people would refrain from making judgments until her work is finished.'Old shoes are there to remind us of all we are spending and what we're missing - nature, and the things we throw away.'The installation will be exhibited at the opening of Seoullo 7017, an old overpass-turned-park, slated for Saturday, and is to be taken down eight days after. The artist hopes to join the city's efforts to renovate the old seemingly useless roadway, by similarly creating an art piece by using shoes that were set for disposal.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); EXHIBITIONS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (73%); RAIL STATIONS & TERMINALS (72%); PRESS CONFERENCES (68%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: May 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

An average tourist wouldn't plan a trip to Seoul just to visit the arts scene unless they're inclined to pay a visit due to their profession in the related field or because of their strong passion and interest.Yet, cities that have become global tourist sites such as Paris, New York and London are well-known for their arts and performance scenes represented by famous venues such as Palais Garnier, Metropolitan Opera and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) or the West End theaters, and these venues are considered must-visit sites for any tourist.Seoul's arts and performance scene is as vibrant and flourishing as these popular global destinations, and in some aspects even more fascinating as its cultural scene is advancing, but global audiences are less aware of it.Sejong as a landmarkSejong Center for the Performing Arts (SCPA) is situated in the most optimum location both in terms of greeting tourists and visitors but also in terms of its historical context - right next to the Gwanghwamun Plaza facing the Gyeongbok Palace.""Even compared to the global arts venues, I would say Sejong is in a comparably great location. Everything happens around here. The coup d'etat went through here and the recent candlelit protests were also held here. Historically and continuing on, occupying the Gwanghwamun was and is equivalent to occupying the leadership in society,"" said Lee Sung-yeop, CEO of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, during an interview with The Korea Times, last week. Lee, a former professor at the Korea National University of Arts, was appointed to CEO in 2014 and will hold the position until the end of this year.""Our center was designated as one of the future cultural assets of Seoul. It's been 40 years since our inception, but I think we've become quite established. As a witness to the historical events that have occurred in our contemporary history, I think we are growing into a historical site with context.""The recent protests calling for President Park Geun-hye to step down for her political scandal was held seven times on the streets of Gwanghwamun, occupying the plaza across from the arts center. The center had opened up its lobby to citizens to use the restrooms during those protests. Interestingly, performances were held simultaneously inside the center while the protest was held outside the window. Lee said the protesters were extremely quiet and respectful when they entered the arts center despite the situation going on outside.""I've also worked at the Seoul Arts Center (SAC) from 1987 to 2001 but the reason the SAC wouldn't be considered a must-visit place is because of the weak historical and traditional context. Sejong has a slight upper hand in that context but we still lack the 'splendor' or magnificence that distinguishes this venue from others. I think what we need adjacent to our historical image is a contemporary one. So we're focusing on building a contemporary image at the moment but it would have to be accompanied by architectural presence,"" said Lee.""What's being considered at the moment is to build a new concert hall next to the SCPA. The city is considering operating it along with the Sejong center. I think that's a great idea. It will help complete the cultural complex here in Gwanghwamun and shorten the journey to becoming a must-visit landmark in Seoul.""What the CEO hopes to introduce is a permanent tour program introducing the venue to visitors guided by a docent.""It will be interesting because it has a story. Visitors don't have to see a performance but they might be interested in the venue itself,"" said Lee.""It won't be profitable. The Metropolitan in New York has a tour program which isn't profitable either. But it's meaningful.""Globalizing servicesUnfortunately the percentage of foreigners - both living in Seoul or coming from overseas - visiting the venue is extremely low. Lee says even the most popular arts venues overseas don't reap high ticket sales from tourists but rather the sales come from the locals. Still, there's a need for expanding the service at the Sejong center to become English-friendly and easier for foreigners to make reservations online.""I think the role of art centers like us is to prepare and provide basic information as faithfully as possible. Many organizations mull over how to attract foreigners to their events. When I was directing the Hi Seoul festival, they placed leaflets in front of hotels. But we don't usually look at leaflets at hotels when we're overseas. They might be necessary when needed, but I think the priority is to make the information available promptly through our website or mobile app,"" said Lee.""We do get requests from the city to produce performances targeted to foreign tourists but I'm not sure if we need to do that. I don't think a foreign audience is any different from the locals. I want us to do what we can do best.""Lee plans to add a reservation and booking function on the center's English website which currently does not carry the service. Although he was not sure how long it would take to apply the service, he agreed with the need for an English service on reserving tickets.Regarding English subtitles for Korean performances, Lee said he would also look into applying it for certain performances with scale.""We currently have English and Korean subtitles for operas and there had been no need for subtitles in classical and dance performances. With musicals, the scenes and scripts change from time to time so it is difficult to be flexible if we have set translated subtitles. But we can definitely try to make the subtitles available for ones that already have them - like 'Hero' which will be open Wednesday. It was already introduced in China and the U.S.,"" said Lee.""Interestingly, according to my observation, some musicals have seen a sudden boost of ticket sales which was attributed to the fans of certain musical singers. About 30 percent would be foreigners. When K-pop stars are featured in the musicals, the rate goes up.""The Sejong center has a unique service where each seat is equipped with a screen per seat, much like an airplane seat.""We were the first to adopt this service in Korea 10 years ago. We thought others would follow our path, but it turned out they didn't.""The center launched a service last year called ""Sejong Season"" which allows customers to buy tickets in advance for the performances to be held that year. Instead of promoting a performance right before it is held, the center scheduled an annual list of performances in advance, like many other global arts centers are doing.""I think everyone in this industry will agree with the need for this system. It meets the global standard. It's really time consuming to keep deciding on a program on a rolling basis. If we have a set schedule, it's much easier to operate,"" said Lee.""It's possible because we have nine performance groups under our wing. Last year, we were able to meet the schedule successfully.""The center saw a slight increase in ticket sales last year since its adoption of the annual program. The customer satisfaction rate increased by 3.3 percent.A new service Lee hopes to add this year is the ""gift package"" service where a person can buy a package ticket to be sent as a present to another person.""I want to send tickets as gifts to my acquaintances so I really hope our center can add a service to our reservation system,"" he said.Despite the various plans, however, the center is struggling financially.""The only way I think we can survive in the future is to collaborate with corporations. We're not looking for unconditional sponsorship from them. We want to provide services that they can use and share with their clients and employees and in return we will receive monetary benefits,"" said Lee. ""Hyundai Motors is already doing a five year project with us for 10 billion won with a media facade on our building promoting the company's image as a culturally advanced company.""LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS (90%); EXECUTIVES (90%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (90%); HISTORY (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); DESTINATIONS & ATTRACTIONS (78%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HISTORIC SITES (75%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); OPERA (70%); COUPS (64%); POLITICS (60%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (50%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%); PARIS, FRANCE (79%); LONDON, ENGLAND (77%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); FRANCE (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is a compilation of three shorts that Moon made during her studies at Chung-Ang University School of Art and Technology in 2014 and 2015 as part of her master??s degree program.The film, a comedy, pokes fun at its lead character with self-deprecating humor.???Humor is a big part of my life,?? said Moon, 43, in an interview at a cafe in Palpan-dong, Seoul, Tuesday.???On our 10th anniversary, I asked my husband whether he regretted marrying me.?? Moon??s husband is film director Jang Joon-hwan. ???He said, ??It would be difficult to meet a woman as funny as you.?? I may not be able to cook him three meals a day, but I believe that we should have conversations filled with humor.?? ? Moon debuted in 1999 in Lee Chang-dong??s ??Peppermint Candy?? as Sun-im, the first love of the suicidal protagonist Yong-ho (Sol Kyung-gu). Her performance as a woman with cerebral palsy in love with an ex-convict in ??Oasis?? (2002) won her an award for best emerging actress at the Venice film festival.Moon believes films need to be warm to portray human life. ???There are actors who have a naturally cold aura. I don??t think I??m a big fan of that. You have to talk about people??s lives (in acting). We probably don??t understand (others) 100 percent. It??s not possible. But I believe that the best method for acting is to love other people. ... I think there has to be warmth toward living beings.?? ?The film also addresses issues of beauty and charm for actresses.???It??s hard for people to know themselves. It??s hard to know how you??re charming. When you??re young, even when people compliment you, it??s difficult to accept that.???Moon says she has had a lot of time to study herself by being an actress.???I told myself that I needed to research myself. I think I know myself better now.?? ?Though she does not like to stand out, when given the opportunity to do something, she does not shirk from it, Moon said.??I felt like (this film) wasn??t just my own story. I felt that women living in our times, people in the movie business, and even men would face the same challenges.?? ?The film portrays a number of men in their 40s who say inappropriate things to Moon??s character. ???People asked, ??Who could be so rude??? The truth is, there are people who are much ruder.???But Moon does not detest these men or the public for the way they treat celebrities -- whether they put them on a pedestal or criticize them.? ??I believe that it comes from a good place, a place of curiosity and good-will. It??s just that the expression is a bit uncomfortable.??Moon has been highlighting the need for diversity in Korean film since the early 2000s.???Right now, the industry might have gotten bigger. More people may be watching films. Those are positive aspects. But diversity in Korean cinema has decreased a lot since then,?? she said. ??There are more female film students in schools.?? Moon said she was influenced by the 2014 film ??Wild,?? starring Reese Witherspoon, who also produced the film. ???The Running Actress?? opens in local theaters on Sept. 14.

Humans won the battle in a landslide victory.According to Kwak Joong-chol, chairman of the Korean Association of Translators & Interpreters, who led the three-member evaluation panel, AI programs revealed major problems in translating literature.'No matter how fast the translation programs are, many will doubt they can perfectly translate subtle expressions of emotion in literature,' said Kim Dong-ik, president of the International Interpretation and Translation Association that co-hosted the battle with Sejong University.The event came amid increased interest in AI following the showdown between Google's AI program AlphaGo and South Korean go champion Lee Se-dol last year.The second battle between humans and AI eased growing concerns that human translators and interpreters may lose their presence, in that it proved humanity is the inviolable element in translation and interpretation - at least for now and the foreseeable future.'Despite the rapid improvement of AI-based automatic translating technologies, I expect literary translation will be the last human territory to be dominated by AI,' said Kim Su-yeon, 32, who works on legal and technical translations. 'I believe readers will still want humane expressions and creativity rather than machine translations.'Some interpreters forecast that humans will outperform AI, especially in interpretations.'Given that people do not always speak with correct grammar, human interpreters can interpret real meaning better than machines,' said Cho Ah-ra, 30, a freelance interpreter, stressing the importance of literature education in nurturing professional translators and interpreters.Kwak noted that translation and interpretation education focuses too much on language education.'I believe students need to receive a deeper education in Korean language to deliver the meaning of more sophisticated sentences,' Kwak said.Adrian Buzo, a professor in the Department of Linguistics at Macquarie University in Australia, echoed Kwak's view.'I noticed among Korean students they are still locked into just simply a language approach,' he said. 'Language of course is important, but by itself is not really defining the quality of a good translator or interpreter. What is important of course is sociolinguistics - the ability to use your language according to many different circumstances.'Buzo stressed that students need to consider broader perspectives than just linguistics.'It is important to expose them to a much broader variety of texts,' he said, adding that he has witnessed that many Korean students tend to study translation on the basis of media texts.'Many professional translators are really not prepared for translating a legal document, a police report or a judge's verdict because they have been studying in a narrow range of texts in education,' Buzo said.Organizers of a translation showdown between human professionals and artificial intelligence (AI) programs use one of the programs to process an original text at Sejong University in eastern Seoul, Tuesday. / YonhapTechnology educationExperts in translation and interpretation spoke about this with one voice; AI programs will someday surpass humans in many areas.'As seen in today's competition, AI translation programs lack the ability to plan translation strategies and use suitable expressions, as of yet,' said Hur Myung-soo, president of the Korean Association of Translation Studies, who participated on a panel in a forum that was a side event of the competition. 'But they will improve in reaching human-level accuracy within a few years.'Kwak, who is also a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies' Graduate School of Translation and Interpretation, emphasized that translation and interpretation schools should introduce more technology-based courses.'Professional translators need to know how to make full use of the latest technology in translation to boost their work efficiency,' Kwak said.'Human translators and interpreters will be eliminated from the market unless they follow the trend to improve themselves.'Buzo also urged the importance of using technology in translation and interpretation.'Technology makes human translators and interpreters far more efficient and far more cost effective in professional duties,' Buzo said. 'Our task is to extend that to the Asia Pacific region, where things are more underdeveloped in the use of technology.'Cho acknowledged that translators and interpreters are destined to receive support from technologies.'Humans can benefit from using technologies,' she said. 'I hope there will be more classes dealing with computer-assisted translation (CAT).'Some experts predicted that the role of human translators and interpreters will be changed.'It is likely that the human translators and interpreters will become editors who supervise and post edited translations that AI programs created,' said Kirk Sung-hee, English language and literature professor at Sookmyung Women's University. Against this backdrop, translator Kim Su-yeon called for new education programs for those who seek to work in translation and interpretation, such as taking a proofreading course.'It will be helpful for students to practice proofreading,' she said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TRANSLATORS & INTERPRETERS (95%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (89%); LITERATURE (89%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); LINGUISTICS (89%); MACHINE TRANSLATION (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); INTERNET & WWW (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); APPLIED LINGUISTICS (73%)COMPANY: GOOGLE INC (85%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (85%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); NORTHERN ASIA (88%); AUSTRALIA (51%)LOAD-DATE: February 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"32",NA,NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"November","[Herald Interview] Finding humanity in design   THE KOREA HERALD November 1, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDNovember 1, 2017 Wednesday[Herald Interview] Finding humanity in design LENGTH: 1465 wordsIn an age where design permeates all industries and all aspects of life, this year's Herald Design Forum questions the role humanity plays in it.At the forum's first session, set to take place Tuesday at 9:20 a.m. at The Shilla Seoul's Dynasty Hall, three global designers will expound on their approach to design. The designers spoke with The Korea Herald prior to the event to answer questions on the fundamental meaning of design and its lasting value. -- Ed.Experimenting without restrictions: Jaime HayonSpanish artist and designer Jaime Hayon served as the design department director at the Benetton-funded Italian design academy Fabrica until 2003. Hayon has since launched his own practice, Hayon Studio, dedicated to projects that range from art installations and interior design to product design. In the following edited excerpts, Hayon answers questions on where the value of design can be found: Is it in functionality, commerciality or in some more fundamental, personal aspect? Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? ã€€A: Value comes from what we cherish most. In many cases it may be about exclusivity or quality but in others it is about the power to communicate an idea. Art is a platform in which the creator can be truly free to let imagination take over. The productivity, the financials and the formal considerations that industrial design require, are not that important in art. I am passionate about experimenting without restrictions. My ideal type of work is trying something new: new shapes, new materials, new methods. Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead the global design industry trend?A: I think individuals with a strong sense of identity, who have something more to bring to the table aside from function, will be leading the design industry. The evolution of the way we live our lives requires objects to transmit emotions and make us feel.Q: You recently founded clothing brand Jijibaba. Fashion brands often expand to furniture or interior design, but it is rare to see moves in the opposite direction. Why did you decide to enter the fashion industry? ã€€A: Exactly because of this: It was very rare. It is a new exercise that opens a new door where I can explore creativity from a new perspective. Being it is a non-conventional approach, it can bring a fresh vision to this field. It has been a very interesting opportunity and I have made good use of my ideas and intuition in a whole different sphere of work.ã€€Q: The Internet of Things is at the center of the 'fourth industrial revolution.ï'At this point, what role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A: I can't judge the entire role of design but I can see the need for design to create an emotional link with its user increases. The internet brought on a totally new way to live our lives, making many things easier and many others more difficult. The sense of closeness being essential to us more now than ever, there are definitively new things to consider regarding design and its role.Specialness of normality: Naoto FukasawaNaoto Fukasawa, the famed Japanese industrial designer behind lifestyle brand Muji's wall-mounted CD player, says he finds creativity in what are considered everyday things. Q: Your design philosophy is 'supernormal.ï'Does that refer to something that is special because it is normal, or something that is the 'most normalï'among all normal things?A: I think my take on 'supernormalï'is about finding or reaching archetypes, or basic patterns that can be reused. Because archetypes are so simple yet so difficult to find, when we reach it, it becomes indispensable. This is what 'supernormalï'means to me. Q: People describe your work as simple and dry, identifying it with the Japanese brand Muji. When did you start preferring designs that are 'special because they are normalï'over flashier ones? ã€€A: I think I have always been looking for archetypes. This part of me has never changed. Of course, as a young designer I was influenced by different movements as well. It takes a long time to realize what is truly 'you.ï'Every artist faces this and it is a lifelong search. But I see only a few other designers who look for archetypes.Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? What is your ideal type of artwork?A: We hesitate to demolish old buildings to build new ones in cities. We award an emotional value to long-lasting city scenes. It is more obvious in Europe where municipals support and protect old buildings. There is a part of human desire that wishes to control and design nature -- we take natural settings and redesign them to build wineries or resorts. I think I can understand it. But I would personally like to design a house where people can look for their own peace. Q: Do you recall a memorable Korean design?A: There are two changes I recall which came from South Korea. The first one is global leadership in the TV industry. South Korean TV manufacturing has taken global leadership and today when we think of TV, we think of your brands.The second is Kia. I remember when German automobile designer Peter Schreyer became the chief designer for Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors. Since that moment, Kia's design has changed significantly.Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead the global design industry trend?A: I think people or organizations that create our living platforms have the power to shift our world. Such organizations have the potential to make a paradigm shift. In many organizations of such kind, they use the term 'campusï'for their office, which has a sense of collectiveness. It communicates the fact that people are gathered in the environment because of their willingness and passion. Encasing the memory of Venice in a table -- Claudio BelliniItalian-born architect-designer Claudio Bellini is the founder and current head of Claudio Bellini Design+Design, recognized as one of the most influential studios worldwide. Bellini has been directing the development of new products for Korean furniture maker Fursys Group since 2010. Q: The Internet of Things is at the center of the 'fourth industrial revolution.ï'At this point, what role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A: We are our artifacts. Since a long time ago, our objects have been the representation of our social and cultural evolution, our research on perfection and beauty. That principle is still the same and will remain the same, but will be projected on a completely different scale because of a new context, characterized by a mix of cultures and different heritages playing together.Of course interaction with our objects is getting now more powerful, sophisticated and intimate because of their intelligence.Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? What is your ideal type of artwork?A: Time is the only judge. Many unpredictable, different reasons contribute to creating a 'classic.ï'Every time that happens, we recognize how that design deeply affects the collective imagination, independent from its practical use or function but based on its symbolic and iconic value. I rarely have the freedom to work in a poetic dimension, but with an Italian client of mine -- Riva 1920 -- I developed a piece of design I really love because there is a unique story behind it that brings emotion.The product is a console table called Venice, and it reuses a briccola wood tree trunk, used in the Venice lagoon to moor the gondolas. The final composition gives the old briccola a second life, reproducing how it used to be on the sea. The symbolic value of that memory is what makes this project unique.People are traveling more and more. I would love to work around this theme, investigating how to design the space of the temporary moving experience, including the interiors of trains and airplanes.Q: Based on your experience with Korean furniture makers iLoom and Bentek Furniture, what are some strengths and weaknesses of designs by Korean companies?A: When working with foreign companies in the area of domestic furniture, the more delicate issue (is) the different lifestyle heritage, which forces the designer and the client to invest lots of time in fine-tuning briefings.The finishes and materials are also, unfortunately, quite derivative compared to the European standard. On the other hand, based on my experience with a company like iLoom over the last five years, there is a great energy and determination to improve their capability in order to achieve a very high design quality.(doo@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERVIEWS (90%); CLOTHING LABELS (78%); INTERIOR DECORATING (78%); FASHION & APPAREL (76%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (75%); INDUSTRY TRENDS (73%); VISUAL ARTISTS (70%); TRENDS (50%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)LOAD-DATE: November 1, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Crimes committed against innocents strikingly resemble those of the Nazis, specified the commission.Atrocities perpetrated against guiltless victims within the Kwanliso political prison camps ??resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the 20th century,?? the commission indicated, while ??public executions and enforced disappearances to political prison camps serve as the ultimate means to terrorize the population into submission.??Even many among those fortunate to escape and resettle in South Korea or other countries continue to live in terror. The commission found that ??most of the potential witnesses ... were afraid to testify, even on a confidential basis, because they feared for the safety of family members.??The Kim dynasty represents a ruthless and all-encompassing despotism like no other, with origins unlike any other. Often characterized as one massive concentration camp, the UN-appointed investigation attests the inherent rights many of us take for granted, such as the freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of opinion, expression, information and association and freedom of movement -- both within the territory and abroad -- are nonexistent inside the North.??Surveillance permeates the private lives of all citizens. ... Citizens are punished for any ... expressions of dissent,?? it affirmed. Kim Jong-un and his predecessors utilized ??food as a means of control over the population,?? prioritizing those deemed useful ??over those deemed expendable.??The Commission of Inquiry pronounced that the domineering Kims had even ??failed to feed the ordinary soldiers of its disproportionately large army,?? while all resources are ??directly controlled by the Supreme Leader.?? As the populace conspicuously starved to death, lavish funds were allocated without interruption toward ??luxury goods and the advancement of his personality cult.??Indeed, for those who have suffered at the hands of Kim??s genocidal organization masquerading as a state, the acronym DPRK merely connotes a Nazi-like fascism -- which imperialism begot.Neither Kim Il-sung nor his progeniture could have ever assumed the helm if democratic processes, rather than division and mutually antagonistic occupation, were permitted from the outset -- that is, if Koreans?? dignity and fundamental rights were respected by those bulldozing, sundering or otherwise laying the groundwork for abhorred edicts behind the native population??s backs.As Gregory Henderson has noted, communism was extremely unpopular in the North before the Stalinist brand -- which has morphed into the Kim dynasty??s personalized monarchical system of exploitation, with a communistic veneer for foreign consumption, although today it is more akin to fascism than communism -- was coercively imposed upon the people. An October 2016 essay in Foreign Affairs said ??personalist dictatorships tend to produce the worst outcomes of any type of political regime,?? based on political science research.During a Jan. 17 conference at Seoul??s National Assembly, former Pyongyang Ambassador Thae Yong-ho stressed that present-day North Korea was ??not a communist country but only a slave society based on hereditary succession.??Attesting to the exasperating fallacies of a compulsorily-split Korea, Henderson noted those in the North were historically more averse to communism than those in the South. He writes concerning pre-divided Korea -- preceding the installation of the DPRK clique -- in ??Divided Nations in a Divided World?? (1974): ??Korea??s small-minority communism was scattered and, if anything, stronger in the peninsula??s southern cities (Seoul and Daegu) and a few southern rural areas than it was in the north. ... Without outside intervention ... the rifts would have been those normal to many governments; they would not have been likely to generate separatism, and certainly not to force the creation of two states divided along or near the 38th parallel. ??Handled within the framework of one government, such potential conflict would have had far shallower roots and a narrower social base than left-right, communist-democratic divisions in other occupied states, for example, in Austria, where division was ultimately avoided.??Whatsoever ??history?? of the North that inexplicably omits or de-emphasizes the central personage of Godang Cho Man-sik (1883-1950) should be handled most vigilantly. Cho, who was assassinated by Kim??s clique on Oct. 18, 1950, was incontrovertibly the most beloved and established political leader within the northern region of the Korean Peninsula prior to and at the time of the division. The Soviets themselves recognized this and sought his assistance, as governance via a ??coalition that would include Northern noncommunist nationalist elements?? appeared to be inevitable -- given the general dislike for communism among those in the North -- as pointed out in a 2004 book by journalist Bradley Martin.It is tremendously saddening to contemplate the sheer contradistinction between Cho, who was a bona fide hero, universally esteemed by Koreans and championed Gandhian non-violence, and the immature, ambitious and catastrophically vain Kim Il-sung -- who incessantly resorted to violence and murder, likely because he was incompetent and lacked support.?At a 2014 press conference, Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry on North Korea Michael Kirby underscored there were ??many parallels?? between North Korea??s crimes against humanity and those of the Nazis. He highlighted the testimony of a former North Korean prisoner who was tasked with burning the bodies of starvation victims and utilizing the remains as fertilizer.?Kirby said, ??When you see that image in your mind of bodies being burned it does bring back memories of the end of World War II, and the horror and the shame and the shock.???Kim Hye-sook was spirited to a concentration camp together with her family at age 13, and was held captive for 28 years -- because her grandfather had fled to the south during the 1950-53 war.?At a 2015 panel on human rights convened at the UN headquarters in New York she shared her horrific experiences.???I was taken to prison camp 18 and I was imprisoned there for 28 years, living in a life that is unimaginable, a life that is worse than a dog??s.?????In this prison we were divided into three per group and we were supposed to monitor each other and write up a detailed report of what the other person has done for the instructor,?? Kim revealed.???If we were not able to do that for different reasons, whether sick or unable to write because we had injured our hands, then they would tear our mouth with plyers or handcuff us until we lost circulation. We were beaten, we were tortured,?? she said.???In this prison camp, especially in the coal mines, you have to be absolutely submissive to (do) anything that was asked of us. If you asked questions about why you were there, you were immediately executed publicly. I have seen and was a witness to multiple executions in this prison. And after Kim II-sung died, and Kim Jong-il came to power, there was an incident (when the regime) sent people who were loyal to Kim Il-sung to prison camps. They were high level officials asking why they were taken to prison camps. If they asked, they were executed immediately.???The time is now to halt the atrocities perpetrated against our people -- who are entitled to protection under the ROK constitution and international law -- in North Korea. Where none are safe from arbitrary arrest, torture and execution -- extending a conditional amnesty for the deposing of Kim Jong-un and the verifiable freeing of political prisoners would be a well-informed modus operandi.By Robert ParkRobert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience.

His isolationist rhetoric and unilateral actions -- such as pulling out of the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- have made it much easier for China to advance its claim to global leadership, as dismayed US allies and partners proclaim that the US can no longer be ??completely depended on,?? as German Chancellor Angela Merkel put it. In stark contrast to Trump, China has reaffirmed its commitments to free trade, globalization and the battle against climate change.China??s case is made more plausible by its markedly increased involvement in what is known as ??global governance.?? China is no longer the free-rider on the Western-built global system that it had long been. President Xi Jinping has received numerous expert briefings and has convened Politburo meetings on global governance. As a result, China has substantially increased involvement in areas such as climate change, global health, international peacekeeping, anti-piracy, anti-corruption, disaster relief, economic governance, development aid, energy security and multilateralism.In part, this reflects Xi??s own ??China Dream?? for his nation??s place in the world. Xi expertly staked out China??s leadership potential at the World Economic Forum in Davos in February in a speech that attracted much international attention. China??s new activism is also due to its sensitivity to foreign criticism for not acting like a true great power (it has a psychological obsession with being seen as one), as well as China??s huge financial wherewithal and the increased professionalism of Chinese bureaucracies.These actions do suggest that China may be ready to fill some of the void in global governance left by an increasingly isolationist America. But there are at least four reasons to question whether China can be an effective global leader.First, while China has been an enormous beneficiary of the Western-dominated global system since the country began its economic reforms in 1978, its leaders have for six decades expressed discontent with the system??s inherent ??inequality.?? While not seeking to overthrow or replace the existing system, Chinese leaders do want to decrease the outsized role of the West and North, while increasing the representation and decision-making clout of the East and South. Where existing institutions cannot accommodate such changes, China has spearheaded a set of alternative ones such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.China is thus a ??revisionist?? power: it seeks not to defend, but to revise the structures and procedures of global governance to reflect what it sees as the real distribution of power in today??s world, although still upholding the existing system in the main.Second, China is neither willing nor able to dispatch military forces to quell threats to global security. China has an extreme aversion to the use of force and to transgressing state sovereignty. Thus the world should not look to Beijing for help in overturning distasteful regimes or countering transnational aggression, at least not outside the United Nations system (China is a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and endorses the UN??s ??Right to Protect?? statute for preventing crimes against humanity.)Third, China??s soft power is seriously lacking. It is far from certain that the country possesses the moral leadership, based on universal values, to become a truly global leader. To be sure, China deserves admiration for its economic and social development, as well as for its 3,000-year civilization. China??s stunning economic growth is the envy of the world, and its urban planning, public health and education systems are all commendable.But does Beijing possess the moral standing and messages to inspire and lead a diverse world? Its human-rights record and political system only inspire other autocrats. At its root, China??s problem is that it is sui generis -- a unique country whose domestic attributes do not travel well beyond its borders.Until China develops values that appeal universally, it will lack one of the core features of global leadership. It also needs to heed its own admonitions about equality and treat its neighbors and other states without coercion or intimidation.Finally, for a nation to be a global leader, it must view the world in positive-sum terms. It must truly believe that the well-being of others is in one??s own national interests and that contributing to ??public goods?? enhances one??s own strength. This is what Trump blatantly rejects in his Hobbesian ??America First?? vision. Until very recently, China had also long practiced a ??China First?? global policy.One senses that China is now in the midst of this conceptual transition. But centuries of isolation, as well as many deeply rooted domestic forces, inhibit its thinking and actions in the world.On balance, China??s role as a global power very much remains a work-in-progress. The country isn??t necessarily ready for prime time; the vacuum Trump has created is forcing it into the spotlight sooner than its leaders had anticipated or planned for. Sometimes nations rise to the occasion, as the US did following World War II. Unless China can overcome its limitations, however, it isn??t likely to become the world??s preeminent power, leaving instead its long-sought preference: a multipolar world.By David Shambaugh David Shambaugh is Gaston Sigur Professor of Asian Studies, Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (77%); GLOBALIZATION (76%); PEACEKEEPING (76%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (76%); GERMAN CHANCELLORS (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (71%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (71%); ECONOMIC POLICY (70%); ECONOMIC NEWS (70%); DISASTER RELIEF (67%); CORRUPTION (52%)ORGANIZATION: WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (55%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (91%); XI JINPING (79%); ANGELA MERKEL (79%)COUNTRY: CHINA (95%); UNITED STATES (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); SWITZERLAND (58%); GERMANY (57%)LOAD-DATE: June 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"37","Students especially good with English",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"April","Students especially good with English  Korea Times April 5, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesApril 5, 2017 WednesdayStudents especially good with EnglishBYLINE: By Lyman McLallenLENGTH: 708 wordsWhen he decided to move to Korea, he figured he would stay for a couple of years and then move back to the United States but he never moved back. When he started working at a university in Korea he discovered that all of the students taking his classes had at least a basic understanding of English. He learned many of them were fluent with the language and intelligently so and he was certain they could enroll in the best universities in the U.S. and do well _ something he knew he could never have done when he was their age, even though he was a native speaker while hardly any of them had lived outside of Korea. But he also knew that not all of them were nearly as fluent and he knew he would have to help these students the most and try not to be dazzled so much by the students who were brilliant.In the city where he lived in the United States, he taught humanities and writing courses at the college of art. Every time before he walked in the classroom he would remind himself that all of the students he worked with knew how to do things he couldnâ€™t do. They could draw, paint, sculpt, work with clay, craft fine woodwork and print and bind beautiful books of paper they made themselves and he could do none of those things. Still, he enjoyed working with the students at the college of art, for they amazed him with the fine objects they made.He began teaching before he was 30, long before he went to Korea. He was in his 40s when he landed at Gimpo Airport in Seoul.The dean at the university that hired him _ a Korean who was a professor of accountancy who had studied for several years in Michigan and spoke English with an informed and pleasant voice _ told him the university wanted him to speak his native English and engage the students with it in and out of the classroom. The dean did not tell him how to teach or what materials to use or anything like that. He wanted him to pour his heart into the classroom _ in English, of course _ which he did, gladly.The students asked him questions _ in English _ that spurred him to think before he answered. He found he had to consider carefully everything they asked him because he wanted to give them good answers they could understand, which might get them to ask him more questions.It surprised him that many of the students he met in Korea had mastered the mechanics of English before they ever entered his classroom. They knew the parts of speech, knew English grammar and could write readable sentences in English. He found he didnâ€™t know nearly as much about the language as they did, at least not the technical aspects of it.What was truly wonderful about them, he thought, was their eagerness to learn more about English, its quirks and nuances, the meanings and origins of idioms, the different styles of pronunciation Americans and other native speakers of the language spoke with. They wanted to know how they could best express themselves with English and he told them the best way he thought they could do that was to read everything they could get their hands on and watch good movies.The classes he taught were two hours long which gave him and the students plenty of time to experiment. He read the English daily newspapers with the students _ like the one you are reading now _ and together they found interesting articles they enjoyed reading.One of the activities he liked to do with the students was to have them memorize a few paragraphs of an article as best they could during the first hour of the class. Then in the second hour he would have them recreate the paragraphs from memory on a piece of paper. He did not grade them on this. He wanted the students to compare for themselves what they had written from memory with the actual paragraphs in the article.When he was an undergraduate student a great teacher did this exercise with his him and his classmates and he remembered how much he learned from doing this. So he did it with the students he was teaching, whether at the college of art or in Korea.In the years he worked as a teacher, he felt if the students learned to enjoy studying English and continued studying it on their own after the semester was finished, then maybe he had served them well.McLallen is a copy editor at The Korea Times.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (77%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (77%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (76%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (72%); DRAWING & ILLUSTRATION (67%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)STATE: MICHIGAN, USA (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (91%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: April 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

This rating is as high as any other entertainment show on major national broadcasters.MBC's flagship entertainment show 'Infinite Challenge' and KBS '2 Days 1 Night' have also aired series of episodes, focusing on the theme of history, and received positive reviews.'In the past, people sought fun-for-fun in entertainment shows. But, nowadays people tend to prefer shows that are both meaningful and fun,' said No Way I'm an Adult's producer Jeong Min-sik, to a local media outlet. 'Unlike other entertainment shows, we offer fun in various genres, ranging from history, education to humanities. Older viewers give us great responses.''No Way I'm an Adult' debuted in 2015, and has held an average 1 to 2 percent viewership in 2016. But this year its latest show, featuring a popular Korean history lecturer Sul Min-seok, has enjoyed a 7 percent jump in viewership.'People have great interest in history and since it is the year's beginning, it also catered to their needs to find something wholesome and family-friendly,' added Jeong.tvN's popular puzzle-solving show 'Problematic Men,' debuted in 2015, has also seen its viewership double this year. Its latest show which aired on Sunday night climbed to 4 percent in viewer ratings, from its average 2 percent.'Infinite Challenge' recently aired 'History X Hip Hop Project' episode, where its hosts composed history-themed songs and had a competition, after listening to the lectures of Sul. One of the songs sung by Kwanghee and Gaeko, a tribute to Korean independence fighter and poet Yun Dong-ju, made it to the top of the charts of Korean music streaming and downloading websites, including Melon and M.net.'2 Days 1 Night' also aired various special episodes on history, tracking down the last three days of Ahn Jung-geun in China or finding the meanings of Korean hangeul letters.Those educational entertainment shows, however, seem to have shortcomings as they are accused of taking history too lightly and evoking patriotism, experts say.'No Way I'm an Adult' aired an episode where a popular lecturer Choi Jin-ki spoke about the Joseon era paintings, but they showed the wrong paintings. The show gave an official apology for not having thorough verification processes and deleted its video on-demand.After that incident, 'Infinite Challenge' said it acknowledges its own limitations but has more positive aspects.

We have neither thick skin nor fluffy fur to protect us from severe cold. We lack the sharp teeth or claws that are necessary to hunt or fight predators. Fortunately, we have fire to warm us in winter and scare off beasts in the wilderness. Although fire has evolved into gas, electricity, and nuclear power in the modern age, it still is something we humans cannot do without. In Greek mythology, Prometheus steals fire from Zeus to help the weak and helpless humankind. As a result, Prometheus is punished by Zeus. He is chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus where his liver is devoured daily by an eagle. But because he is immortal, his liver regenerates every night. Later, Hercules comes by and frees him. Had it not been for Prometheus's invaluable forethought, humankind could not have survived and would have become extinct by now. The name Prometheus means 'foresightï'while Epimetheus, which is his brother's name, means 'hindsight.ï'Prometheus is wise because he can foresee the future and move forward, whereas Epimetheus is foolish because he always looks back to the past and realizes his mistakes too late. Consequently, we all remember Prometheus, but few people know who Epimetheus is. When Zeus creates Pandora, the first woman, and sends her to Prometheus in retaliation. Epimetheus, who cannot foresee the future, unwisely lets her in despite Prometheus's admonition not to accept any gifts from Zeus. Pandora means 'all-givingï'which is an appropriate name for the first woman. She brings a jar, often mistranslated as a box, which she is not supposed to open. Out of curiosity, however, she opens the box and all the diseases of humanity escape from the jar. The only thing that remains is 'hope.ï'Thus, humankind can endure and sustain thanks to the 'hopeï'that still remains among us. The mythology of Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Pandora teaches us valuable lessons. As for Pandora's box, we learn that we should be discreet when receiving gorgeous gifts from someone without reason. We also learn that 'curiosity killed the cat.ï'So many fairy tales tell us stories of those who are ruined due to their curiosity. So do the stories from the Arabian Nights. It is also noteworthy that like Eve in the Bible, Pandora, too, is blamed for the transgression and the degradation of humankind due to her vulnerability to temptation. Obviously, this originates from men's prejudice against women. We can also learn a valuable lesson from Epimetheus and Prometheus who signify the past and the future, afterthought and forethought, or slow learners and fast learners, respectively. If we benchmark Epimetheus who lacks foresight and is past-oriented, we are likely to make grave mistakes of taking in Pandora who brings catastrophe. Then inevitably we will be doomed and end up regretting. Sadly, it will be too late to straighten out our mistakes. If we wisely follow future-oriented Prometheus, however, we will be remembered as heroes, even though we may be punished by some superpower. We may be chained to a rock and our liver may be eaten by a predator. Yet, our liver will be regenerated every day and surely Hercules will come to our rescue some day. Then we will be hailed as a pioneer of human civilization and protector of humankind. We will be esteemed as someone who has brought 'a red flowerï'or 'fireï'to the international community, which will make people warm and the world bright. Although Prometheus and Epimetheus are twin brothers, they are quite different. Prometheus who can see the future is wise and Epimetheus who can only see the past is foolish. If you look back on the past, there will be so many things you regret and you will be haunted by those dark memories and will become miserable. What is done cannot be undone. If you look to the future, however, you will be hopeful and bright. There is a maxim in English: 'He is wise who looks ahead.ï'It means only fools keep returning to the past. Like Prometheus, we should have foresight, instead of hindsight. We should be able to see what lies ahead of us, instead of hopelessly clinging to the dark past for good. Unfortunately, humans are the descendants of Epimetheus, not Prometheus. Nevertheless, we can still make a choice. Between Prometheus and Epimetheus, between foresight and hindsight, and between the bright future and the dark past, what should we choose? The answer is so obvious. Yet we seem to foolishly regress into the labyrinth of the dark past, instead of soaring into the bright future. If we keep returning to the past, we will not be able to come back. We are at the crossroads now and should choose the right path. If we chose the wrong direction, we will be doomed. Which way should we take? The choice is ours. But one thing is clear. We should look to the futureBy Kim Seong-konKim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and president of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea.

The temporary suspension, which reflects President Moon??s vision of making South Korea nuclear free, immediately drew fire from a range of groups including conservative parties and Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power??s labor union. The panel will select a group of citizens who will make the final decision on whether to cancel the construction of the reactors in Ulsan. The final decision is to be made by Oct. 21.While Moon??s government is set on nuclear-free energy policies, critics say that abandoning the project will incur some 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in sunk costs and trigger many job losses. As soon as the committee was launched, opposition parties opened fire, accusing Moon of ??imperial presidency?? and attacking the committee for lacking legal grounds. ??The party??s legal team is reviewing the matter, and (if) there is clear violation of the law (in the committee??s formation), legal steps will be taken,?? Liberty Korea Party Floor Leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik said Tuesday. Liberty Korea Party policy chief Rep. Lee Hyun-jae echoed the view, saying that the committee lacked legitimacy. ??(The committee) is an arbitrary civilian organization for carrying out the president??s imperialistic orders,?? Lee said.??The president has already declared that more reactors could be shut down by 2030, it is worrisome whether this organization can make an unbiased and fair decision.?? Kim Moon-soo, the outspoken former Gyeonggi Province governor of the Liberty Korea Party, also chimed in, accusing the government of making groundless decisions and of mob justice. ??The committee is a kangaroo court that upholds the will of the candlelight emperor,?? Kim wrote on his social media account, referring to the president. Kim went on to accuse Moon of violating government finance and nuclear safety laws by halting construction approved by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission after 38 months of deliberation. The minor opposition People??s Party appears to be siding with the conservatives on the issue, echoing the main opposition??s views. ??Halting the construction of nuclear reactors that are 29.8 percent complete at a cost of 1.6 trillion won is a very important matter,?? Rep. Son Kum-ju, who heads the party??s committee on Moon??s nuclear-free policy. ??It is not a matter that can be covered up with gimmicks such as a committee that lacks legal grounds, and citizen jurors.?? Saying that the committee lacked expertise as well as legal grounds and fails to represent Korean society, Son accused the government of using the committee as a scapegoat. The public, which has shown overwhelming support for Moon and a number of his policies, is equally divided on the issue. A Gallup Korea poll conducted on July 14 showed that 41 percent of the public support scrapping the two Shin-Kori reactors, while 37 percent think that the construction should be resumed. The margin of error in the poll is 3.1 percent. The committee has also been attacked for lacking expertise in the field of nuclear energy. The committee is headed by Kim Ji-hyung, a former Supreme Court justice, and has eight members, two each from four categories: humanities and society; science and technology; survey and statistics; and conflict management. However, neither of the two science and technology members are experts in nuclear energy. The two scientists on the committee are Yu Tae-kyung, a chemical engineering professor at Kyung Hee University, and physics professor Lee Sung-jay of the Korea Institute for Advanced Study.By Choi He-suk (cheesuk@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY (89%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (78%); CONSERVATISM (78%); ENERGY & UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (78%); JURY TRIALS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); POLITICS (77%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (77%); CONSTRUCTION DELAYS & STOPPAGES (76%); LABOR UNIONS (69%); APPROVALS (61%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: July 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Chicago's is tough and tender. Gangster and Midwestern. Violent and benevolent. Chicago is the Great Fire of 1871. It is the World's Columbian Exposition 22 years later, lusty and industrious. It is Hull House. It is jazz. It is 'The Blues Brothers.' It is the bootstrap of the first African-American U.S. president.But Chicago has another enduring if underappreciated story.The summer of 2018 will mark the 50th anniversary of Special Olympics, an organization with deep Chicago roots that is now the largest sporting competition in the world for intellectually disabled children and adults. What began as an idea for a simple track-and-field event at Soldier Field branched into a global community serving 4.9 million athletes in 172 countries. The 2019 summer games will be held in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.The rise of Special Olympics during the last 50 years represented more than a popular sporting event. It marked the beginning of a shift in humanity. Disabled children and adults, often abandoned, institutionalized and isolated, joined mainstream society. They were seen. They were celebrated. Countries that once confined the disabled to prisonlike conditions have now embraced and even hosted the games.That worldwide culture change launched, slowly, with a partnership that included Eunice Kennedy Shriver of the Kennedy family foundation, now-Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Park District.Burke, who was teaching physical education classes to disabled children at the Park District, wanted to reach more students. She saw how recreation programs changed them, challenged them, encouraged them. She approached city officials with the idea of a citywide track meet.A natural partner, the Kennedy family with Shriver leading the way had championed the needs of the disabled community. President John F. Kennedy had prioritized care for the disabled with federal funding and numerous acts of Congress to expand opportunities for this population. With the resources and enthusiasm of Mayor Daley, the Kennedys, Burke and the Park District, the first Special Olympics unfolded at Soldier Field in July 1968. Athletes from 26 states and Canada participated in the 50-yard dash, 300-yard run, field hockey, swimming and jumping.A Chicago Tribune story published July 21, 1968, quoted Shriver: 'The Chicago Special Olympics proves retarded children can be exceptional athletes; that thru (sic) sports they can realize their potential for growth. But they are only 1,000 out of 1.5 million mentally retarded children who should be given a chance to compete in games like this all over America. Our purpose here today is to secure a pledge that all retarded children will be given this chance in the future.'Special Olympics Chicago has since helped establish programs for disabled children in more than 120 Chicago public schools and parks across the city. The worldwide 50th anniversary celebration is planned for July 17-21 in Chicago. A soccer game, sports activities, concerts and a torch run are among the expected events.The anniversary will become part of Chicago's story, too _ another chapter in its role establishing a new era for the disabled. Special Olympics might not be as legendary to Chicago as 'The Blues Brothers' or two World's Fairs (the 1933-4 Century of Progress International Exposition included) or even the Cubs or deep-dish pizza. But there's no question Special Olympics arguably has had a far greater impact on the world around us.For that, Chicago should be proud.The article appeared in the Chicago Tribune (www.chicagotribune.com).

As for designing for production, we work within boundaries as we have to consider both the users and companies,' said Jaime Hayon, a Spanish industrial designer and head of Hayon Studio, at a Design Talk session hosted by Kim Daniel, head of Daylight Design. 'So I think the way to harmonize those two is to integrate what we learn from fine art to industrial design.ï'Claudio Francesco Bellini, CEO and founder of Claudio Bellini Design+Design from Italy, agreed that designers now have to value not only 'styling,ï'but also practicality and communication with clients. Despite such complications, Naoto Fukasawa, a Japanese product designer and head of Naoto Fukasawa Design, emphasized that fine art and design are similar in that they enlighten people and allow them to realize commonalities shared among humans. In terms of the permeation of technologies such as 3-D printing into design, Hayon emphasized the importance of not losing humanity. 'To me, design process is more like a humane side. Computers may excel in calculating proportions, but they can't surpass what humansï'hands are capable of.ï''About 40 years ago, designs for automobiles were different, as they were all handmade.

They later cremated the body and extorted a ransom from Jee's wife pretending he was still alive.There was no evidence that Jee was involved in any crimes.Following his death, Duterte expressed his condolences to Jee's family. But in his latest statement, he said Korean organized crime may be behind the murder, claiming many Koreans have engaged in illegal narcotic and prostitution operations - especially in Cebu City, a popular destination for Korean tourists.According to local media, Cebu police have already started to track down Korean criminal suspects.Observers say this might be Duterte's attempt to placate police officers, who have played a key role in carrying out his violent anti-drug campaign.Ministry officials said they will release a statement in response to Duterte's threats against Korean criminals, but gave no details on when.Duterte's aggressive crackdown on drug suspects he initiated in the summer of 2016 has so far resulted in more than 7,000 deaths across the country.Human rights groups have criticized the ruthless campaign, with Amnesty International calling the executions a 'war on the poor' that 'may amount to crimes against humanity.' Duterte has vowed to continue the crackdown until his term ends in 2022.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); DEATH & DYING (90%); CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); POLICE FORCES (90%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (89%); MURDER (89%); CITY LIFE (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); EXTORTION (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (76%); KIDNAPPING & ABDUCTION (76%); ORGANIZED CRIME (76%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (75%); DRUG POLICY (75%); ILLEGAL DRUGS (75%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (73%); FALSE IMPRISONMENT (73%); DRUG TRAFFICKING (70%); HUMAN RIGHTS (63%); DESTINATIONS & ATTRACTIONS (62%); HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS (60%)PERSON: RODRIGO DUTERTE (94%)COUNTRY: PHILIPPINES (94%); SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA (92%); ASIA (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: February 8, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The parties had resisted their appointment citing ethical breaches that Moon had said would preclude people from top posts during the campaign.Following the president??s remark, and peace-making gestures in the legislature by his aides, the Bareun Party and the People??s Party withdrew their objections, making it likely that Prime Minister nominee Lee Nak-yon will be approved in a parliamentary floor vote on Wednesday.But the biggest conservative group, the Liberty Korea Party, continued to voice its opposition.??I have no intention of damaging the basic principles (of prioritizing integrity when selecting high-profile government officials),?? the president said during his weekly meeting with secretariat members.??I only ask for the opposition lawmakers?? and the people??s understanding over the fact that (the Moon administration) did not have the time to set up tangible rules (before making personnel announcements.)??Prime Minister nominee Lee had come under fire for falsely registering a residential address in the past. Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha and Fair Trade Commission Chairman nominee Kim Sang-jo were accused of similar wrongdoings.The Resident Registration Act states that one may be sentenced to a maximum term of three years or a fine of 10 million won ($8,900) for falsely reporting one??s address. The key purpose of the regulation was to deter excessive real estate speculation, something high-profile public servant nominees have often been accused of in the past.In Lee??s case, his wife had temporarily changed her address, as she sought to get a job as an art teacher in a preferred high school in Seoul.Although deemed less serious compared to other cases of corruption, such incidents seemed to contradict the principle??s President Moon campaigned on.Moon had asserted that high-profile government posts should be denied to those involved in five types of corruption, including false residence registration.??I (still) believe that this rule is highly important in order to build a fair society. But what I said was a principle and for this to take effect in reality, we need more detailed standards,?? Moon said.??Had there been a transition committee, we would have drawn detailed rules on personnel appointment in advance (before inauguration) but due to the lack of time and the consequently pressing schedule, the appointments came to face disputes.??President Moon took office on May 10, without a transition period right after the May 9 election, to fill in state leadership that had remained vacant since former President Park Geun-hye??s ouster by impeachment on March 10.Earlier in the morning, Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Jun Byung-hun made his way to the National Assembly to talk with Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and floor leaders of four parties.??It is true that the prime minister appointment was made in a hurry as we were trying to minimize the vacuum (in state affairs),?? Jun said in the meeting, offering an apology to the participants.This was the second apologetic gesture from Cheong Wa Dae, following that by presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok on Friday.With the inauguration of the Moon government, pressure escalated on the appointment of a new prime minister. With predecessor Hwang Kyo-ahn out of the position, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, who is also set to step down, is heading the Cabinet. The centrist People??s Party, which holds 40 out of the 299 parliamentary seats, embraced the president??s gestures.??While Lee has some problems, our party decided to cooperate in the appointment process,?? said floor leader Kim Dong-cheol, urging the president to show some responsible actions hereafter.The minority conservative Bareun Party, too, gestured its consent for the nominations, though it also criticized the president, accusing him of inconsistency.The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, however, held its ground and set to deter the prime minister??s appointment.??Our party platform is to refuse Lee??s appointment as prime minister,?? said the party??s acting chief and floor leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik.??We are only asking the president to keep the promise he himself had made.??Despite the brawl over the president??s personnel decisions, public sentiment remained largely in support of the new state leader over the weekend.According to a survey released by pollster Realmeter on Monday, those in favor of President Moon??s state administration stood at 84.1 percent, up 2.5 percentage points from the previous week.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com) and Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); POLITICS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); PERSONNEL CHANGES (78%); ETHICS (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (76%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (76%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); APPROVALS (73%); REAL ESTATE (73%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (70%); CONSERVATISM (69%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (62%); SENTENCING (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (94%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

By Kwon Mee-yooArtist Ryu Kyung-chaiArtist Ryu Kyung-chai (1920-1995) was a pioneer of Korean abstract art in the post-independence era but is often neglected compared to his peers Kim Whan-ki and Yoo Young-kuk due to strong self-reverence and less self-promotion. An exhibition sheds light on this forgotten master who pursued poetic lyricism in nature throughout his life.The ""Ryu Kyung-chai: Abstract Painting 1960-1995"" exhibition at Gallery Hyundai in downtown Seoul features some 50 works from Ryu's oeuvre. Organized chronologically, the exhibit unravels how the artist developed the world of abstract art from non-figurative art in the 1960s to geometric abstract paintings in his latter days of the '90s.Born in Haeju, Hwanghae Province, now in North Korea, Ryu is mostly well-known for winning the grand prize at the inaugural National Art Exhibition in 1949 with ""Neighborhood of a Bare Mountain."" The painting, illustrating a desolate landscape of Wangsimni in Seoul, is abstract despite the specific location, signaling Ryu's inclination to lyrical abstraction that bloomed later.He was also a prominent figure in Korean art education, teaching at Ewha Womans University and Seoul National University. However, Ryu only had two solo exhibitions in his life -- one in 1983 and the other in 1990.Yoo Hee-young, a painter and pupil of Ryu, said Ryu's nearly obsessive perfectionism prevented him from being prolific and holding many exhibitions.'The phrase ¡®an artist who pioneered lyrical abstraction' is often used to describe Ryu, but this is not sufficient to explain the artist. What needs to be emphasized in the analysis of Ryu and his art is his ¡®constant artistic inclination to interact with nature.' For his peculiar lyrical view of nature continuously fed into his restrained minimalistic compositions and ceaseless attempts at geometric division,' Yoo said.As his style became non-figurative in the ¡®60s, Ryu continued to take inspiration from nature. He was particularly interested in the change of seasons as represented in a series of paintings named after the 24 divisions of the year such as 'Haji' (Longest Day in the Lunar Calendar) and 'Jungbok' (Second Hottest Day of Summer in the Lunar Calendar).His brushstrokes became more concise and simplified in the ¡®80s as the artist attempted to visualize light on his canvas.""I think that a painting is inherently a poem and a song embodied with light. Once having the subject matter in mind and murmuring it as a poem, its murmurs would be visible as light, then I'd transfer it to a painting. In 'Day,' I want to let the murmurs of light be heard as echoes rather than providing the image in a direct manner. Thus, I try to hide it partially with white,"" Ryu commented on the ""Day"" series mainly produced in the ¡®80s.His final works are more geometric, reflecting rapid social and political changes in Korea during the democratization process. Ryu captured the transformation in triangular and square color fields in pink, purple and white.Kookmin University professor Kim Hee-young said, ""Maybe it would not be easy to categorize Ryu's work with a relatively collective style due to his individual endeavor to explore and seek his own style. With little interest in following dominant styles or in attracting public attention, Ryu made an effort to embody his life experiences as painter, teacher and administrator.""The exhibit runs from Jan. 5 to Feb. 5.

He respects nature and explores the relation between substances,"" Bartomeu Mari, director of MMCA, said.""Shim Moonseup, Sculpture of Nature"" uses two galleries and the Main Hall on the first floor of MMCA, Gwacheon, which is available thanks to Shim's prolific career.Shim's oeuvre is displayed in chronological order, starting with the 1970s when the artist won the National Art Exhibition. He won a series of awards from the late '60s at the national contest, which was the only gateway for young artists back then.""People get several chances throughout their lives and my first chance came when I was born in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. I grew up communing with nature,"" the 74-year-old artist said. ""Back then, the National Art Exhibition was the only art contest in the nation. If I missed one, I had to wait a year to present my work. So I had to put everything in my work and explored what my art was while preparing for the competition.""His works drew international attention as Shim took part in the Paris Biennale on three occasions from 1971 to 1975. It provided him with rare chances to travel abroad and extend his horizons.'Shim's works attempt to reveal the phenomena of nature left intact rather than embodied. The exhibit explores how concepts of materiality, which emerged in Korean sculpture in the ¡®70s, have both influenced and evolved through Shim's work,' MMCA curator Park Su-jin said.His early works ""Relations,"" ""Opening Up"" and ""Thoughts on Clay"" series use common materials such as earth, tree branches, rocks, cement and ropes and in rather crude, natural shapes.""It demonstrates how Shim used simple materials to reveal the symbolism latent in the relationship among different materials,"" curator Park said. ""Viewers will see the meaning of circularity that governs nature - how a rock becomes earth and how earth becomes a rock - of which humanity is just a tiny part of.'Later in the '90s, Shim revisited his works to produce his ""Re-present"" series, in which he reinterpreted his own works.The exhibit runs through Oc. 9.

Once was during the Han Dynasty (206 BC ? 220 AD) when China made four 'commanderies' in the northern part of the peninsula. Whether it could be seen as the Chinese ruling is still controversial among historians. The other event is from the Mongol empire's domination in the 13th century including China and Korea.

One was ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? by Kim Hyong-o, a former National Assemblyman and house speaker. The other was ??Korea 4.0 Now?? by Kang Tae-jin, a professor of textile engineering and former dean at Seoul National University. While I was reading the two books, I could not but help nod frequently. Both books were well-argued, highly persuasive, penetrating and illuminating. Above all, they were thought-provoking and eye-opening. ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? argues that our political leaders have seriously lacked magnanimous leadership, that is, the capacity of embracing others, including their political opponents. Instead of embracing the differences, our leaders have almost always antagonized and turned their backs on those who do not belong to their faction, no matter how able and competent they are. Before appointing someone at a government post, our narrow-minded leaders have always asked, ??Is he one of us??? or ??Was he in our election camp??? Kim also argues that our social or political leaders have also lacked noblesse oblige, that is, the spirit of sacrifice, responsibility and decency that comes with privelege. In the eyes of the people, they just savor power bestowed upon them. But a true leader is one who is ready to sacrifice himself for people in an emergency. Unfortunately, our leaders have always disappointed us. When the Korean War broke out, our first president fled to the south, destroying the Han River Bridge as he left, so people could not escape from Seoul. The captain of the ill-fated Sewol abandoned his ship, leaving passengers to drown. When there was an earthquake, a school principal, instead of protecting or rescuing his students, reportedly escaped alone. ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? also laments our leaders?? clumsiness and incompetence in times of crisis. For example, when the Sewol sank or when the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic spread, our leaders exhibited total incompetence. How can we trust and respect such inept leaders? Furthermore, no one assumes responsibility in Korean society when something happens. Kim also urges our political leaders to tear down the wall of collective selfishness and break the shell of factional antagonism. Indeed, our society urgently needs integration and reconciliation. After reading Kim??s insightful book, I hope that one day we all could sit at the table of reconciliation, singing together in unison and dancing joyously to peaceful music. The other book, ??Korea 4.0 Now,?? emphasizes the importance of convergence to integrate different academic disciplines such as engineering, medicine, education and the humanities. In the book, Kang encourages not only interdisciplinary, but also multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in academia that would enable us to have more sophisticated, comparative perspectives. The book calls for modern-day Renaissance men in Korean society. Kang also highlights that in order to accomplish true convergence and consilience, we should be creative. According to the book, creativity can be fostered by educational reform. Kang boldly argues that the binary evaluation system that forces students to choose the one and only right answer out of five possible answers should be abolished because it blocks diverse possibilities of creative thought. Kang says that so many revolutionary scientific discoveries inadvertently stem from random questions or what we perceive as wrong answers. In scientific terms, he writes, it is called ??serendipity.?? In ??Korea 4.0 Now,?? Kang contends that our future will be shaped by our excellence not only through creativity, but also artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, bioengineering, big data and other technologies that belong to the ??fourth industrial revolution.?? He urges that we should be prepared for the upcoming social change. In his book, Kang brings up an incident. At a G-20 summit meeting in 2010, Barack Obama repeatedly gave Korean reporters a chance to ask a question. Regrettably, no Korean reporters spoke at the time, whereas a Chinese reporter tried to ask questions several times. Kang blamed the Korean education that does not encourage people to ask questions. In my opinion, they could also have been silent because they were unsure of their English proficiency. Experts maintain that our English education has totally failed, because its main concern is not how to express yourself, but how to choose the grammatically right answer at the college entrance exam. If so, educational reform is imperative in Korea. After reading the two books, I pondered on the future of Korea. The two authors urge us to change. For example, we should put an end to populism, which is likely to make our nation bankrupt eventually, if pushed to the extreme. We should root out chronic factional brawls and unite. We should also try to change the future, not the past. In the movie ??Dragon Blade,?? Jackie Chan narrates, ??While cowards cling to the past, courageous men change the future.??

"57","Research reveals Koreans' genetic roots '",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","Research reveals Koreans' genetic roots '  Korea Times February 2, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesFebruary 2, 2017 ThursdayResearch reveals Koreans' genetic roots 'LENGTH: 667 wordsJong Bhak, biomedical engineering professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Genomic Institute / Courtesy of Ulsan National Institute of Science and TechnologyBy Yoon Sung-wonSeen above is a skull of an ancient female human collected from a cave named 'Devil's Gate' in eastern Russia, north of Tumen River.Genome analysis of human DNA from the Neolithic era has revealed for the first time that modern Korean people have genetic roots with an ancient people from the Russian far east and southern Asia, according to Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Wednesday.The Genomics Institute of UNIST's biomedical engineering department, international archeologists, biologists and genome researchers from Britain, Russia and Germany have sequenced and analyzed the genome of female Eastern Asians who are estimated to have lived some 7,700 years ago.Their DNA samples were collected from a cave named 'Devil's Gate' in eastern Russia, north of the Tumen River. The research is the world's first analysis on an ancient genome collected from East Asia, UNIST said.The research team compared the Devil's Gate cavemen's genome to those of multiple Asian modern day ethnic groups. Consequently, they discovered that a genome combination of the ancient Devil's Gate cavemen and indigenous people of Vietnam and Taiwan best matched Koreans.Jong Bhak, a biomedical engineering professor at the Genomic Institute who led the research team, said Koreans' genetic roots have been created from the mix of northern and southern Asian races.'This matches not only the migration of genes but also thousands of years of history,' he said. 'This is biological evidence that definitely explains the creation of Koreans' roots and the consequences.'Proportionally, actual genetic composition of modern Koreans is inclined to southern Asians because the people in the south thrived on agriculture compared to northern races that had mainly lived on hunting and gathering, he added.Bhak also said East Asians including Koreans had a greater internal identity compared to other ethnic groups worldwide.'The massive ethnic group including the Han race of China, Koreans and Japanese had such a high homogeneity,' the professor said. 'This shows that they had exponentially expanded through the evolution of civilizations with agricultural technologies.'The research revealed that the humans who lived in the Devil's Gate cave had genetic traits including brown eyes and shovel-shaped incisors, like Koreans. They also had typical genetic distinctions and variations of modern East Asians such as inability to digest milk, vulnerability to high blood pressure, relatively odorless bodies and dry earlobes.This shows that modern East Asians have better preserved genetic traces of their ancestors for thousands of years, compared to modern western Eurasians who have lost genetic signs of their ancestors through more migration and warfare, the research team said.'East Asians have preserved genetic continuity in each ethnic group without an inflow of outsiders for at least the last 8,000 years,' said Jeon Sung-won, a researcher at UNIST Genomic Institute.'Instead of conquering and eliminating other existing ethnic groups, people with revolutionary new technologies such as agriculture spread these and maintained lifestyles that fit in with regional nature.'According to the research, the humans who lived in the Devil's Gate cave were the ancestors of the Ulchi people. As a minority race, they live in Far East Russia and spoke a Tungusic language. Except for the Ulchi people, Koreans turned out to have a similar mitochondrial genome type to ancient humans.'Having the same type of mitochondrial genome means having the same maternal line,' Jeon said. 'We can say that the humans who lived in the Devil's Gate cave were almost like the ancestors of Koreans.'The research has been published in the Feb. 1 edition of international scientific journal Science Advances, UNIST said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: GENOMICS (92%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (91%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); BIOMEDICINE (90%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (90%); ENGINEERING (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); DNA (90%); ETHNICITY (89%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (89%); ETHNIC GROUPS (88%); AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); GENES & CHROMOSOMES (78%); AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY (78%); GENEALOGY (78%); GENETIC ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES (78%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (77%); DNA TESTING (76%); BIOLOGY (73%); ARCHAEOLOGY (72%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (69%); AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT (62%)COUNTRY: EASTERN ASIA (94%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (93%); ASIA (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); TAIWAN (79%); GERMANY (79%)LOAD-DATE: February 2, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Here, he forecast a future where the exponential growth of the human population would exceed the linear growth of food production, resulting in worldwide famine and poverty.With the unexpected technological progress, however, his prediction proved to be profoundly misguided. The growth of food production surpassed that of the population. What he totally missed was the everlasting technical development and increasing productivity.Today, more than two centuries later, a skeptical outlook on the global economy still exists, although to a lesser extent than Malthus' prediction. Rapid economic developments have led to environmental destruction and widening income disparities. These negative impacts may ultimately lead to an economic collapse.But could there be something we have overlooked in making these pessimistic forecasts? Just as Malthus failed to take into consideration technological progress, perhaps we have also neglected the importance of a critical variable - sustainable development. With sustainable development in the picture, the future looks more promising. Sustainable development is the key to nurturing an ecosystem that develops in harmony with economic, social and environmental values.The second annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will be held on Jeju Island for three days from June 16 to 18. The theme of this meeting is 'Sustainable Infrastructure.' In history, investments in infrastructure did drive economic growth during this time. But investment decisions that were purely based on economic cost and benefits have resulted in numerous unintended and negative side effects.With global warming, abnormal climate conditions have been observed around the world; inequality has deepened among regions and across income classes. Now, time calls for a change in deciding infrastructure investments. We must take into account the social and environmental values of infrastructure. Sustainable infrastructure will lay a solid foundation for sustainable development.Recently, sustainable development has caught the attention of the international community. In September of 2015, the United Nations has set 'sustainable development goals' as its medium-term development agenda for the humanities. And development projects by the World Bank and other multilateral development banks began to address the necessity of sustainability.The AIIB, a new international organization that was formed last year, is also taking part in this global trend. Adopting sustainable development as the core strategy of the bank seems very timely. In particular, considering that the Asian infrastructure market makes up the biggest share of the global market at 32 percent, and the demand for new infrastructure in the region will be $38 trillion by 2030, AIIB must play an especially significant role in the international community.The world is already undergoing a drastic transformation, also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. While the previous industrial revolutions overlooked their social and environmental impacts, the Fourth Industrial Revolution must unfold with a focus on sustainable development.This is why the upcoming AIIB's annual meeting serves an important purpose at this critical juncture. This yearly gathering will be attended by over 2,000 participants including finance ministers, governors of central banks, and other policymakers from 77 member countries, as well as representatives from international organizations and from financial and business sectors. This is also the first time for the AIIB to hold its annual meeting outside its headquarters.I look forward to a productive meeting that will foster valuable discussions on sustainable infrastructure.

"59","Turtle thinking",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Turtle thinking  Korea Times January 31, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesJanuary 31, 2017 TuesdayTurtle thinkingBYLINE: By Bernard RowanLENGTH: 696 wordsAn early memory of visiting Korea is images of turtles I saw in various places such as palaces and temples. I think the Korean symbol of turtles shows us wisdom about life. Let's consider anew the meaning of Korean turtles.Koreans respect turtles as symbols of long life, good life, and knowledge of the future. Many Buddhist temples have stele or tablet turtle monuments that commemorate a monk's life. When considering Buddhism and the work of Buddhist monks and temples, it's wonderful to reflect on turtle images and to read the stele. The turtle stands as a prayer, wish, and hope that life's meaning will endure. I also think it means that life finds expression in what a monk gives to others. Life begets life in its wonder and variety.In the distant past, turtle shells had the use of fortune-telling. The shells provided a way to see the future. I'm not so sure how reliable they've proved. However, I like the image of the turtle's shell standing for heaven and the square below the turtle the earth. Turtles hold up the universe in this Taoist way of thinking. A popular example is the baby turtle sitting on its parent's back. Long life also includes the life cycle and giving life to the next age. Korean turtles show these important meanings about life. I read that Korean monks release fish and turtles into their native habitats as a sign of giving life and respecting it.Chinese and Japanese cultures also revere turtles and consider them in similar ways. A turtle shows the relations between heaven, earth, humanity and nature. It tells us that we are microcosms of the infinite. We mightn't be infinite ourselves, but we share in it and can carry such understanding into living as a way of survival, of coping, and of finding happiness and contentment.A Japanese mythology and folklore website tells the story of a man, Urashima Taro, who protected a sea turtle from abuse. The grateful turtle takes the man to see the king of the sea who allows him to marry his daughter, the princess. The man then returns to his hometown and finds he has traveled into the future. This story says respect for turtles brings life and understanding beyond one's years.In another sense, turtles call us to understand the sea, freshwater, and all nature, on which human life depends. Life, the great chain of being, reveals interconnectedness everywhere, but many struggle to admit this truth. Humans shouldn't wish to distinguish themselves too strongly from other parts of nature. The turtle stands as a reminder of universal interdependence. Thoughts, words, and deeds that disrupt the balance of heaven and earth threaten life, good living, humanity, and nature.In Western culture, Aesop's story of the turtle and the rabbit stands for patience. The turtle moves slowly in a race, but it defeats the rabbit. The rabbit has speed but lacks understanding and constancy. Its rapid, changing movement makes it slower than the slow. The story's meanings include avoiding hubris and cultivating prudence. On a different level, it shows a path of wisdom related to love, faith, and reaching a goal in life.I also have seen displays about Korea's famous naval general, Yi Sun-shin, and the 'turtle ships.' Yi achieved great victories over the Japanese in the Imjin Wars, but his success owes more to superior design of cannons and the speed of his vessels. The Choson Korea website suggests the ships weren't like turtles, unless one compares their size or design to a turtle's back. However, their military design achieved turtle thinking through balancing force and speed efficiently.These days, Korea faces many challenges, perhaps unlike any other time. Nonetheless, Korean turtles remind us that impeached presidents, corrupt business and political leaders, THAAD, Hell Korea, and Kim Jong-un are temporary. None last forever. What stands forever is turtle thinking, seeking balance and harmony for real life and good living.Bernard Rowan is associate provost for contract administration and professor of political science at Chicago State University.

Cooperation between our states is consistently developing in all directions due to the regular nature of the dialogue at the highest level and common aspirations.I especially want to note that this year our countries are widely celebrating the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Republic of Uzbekistan and the Republic of Korea, after the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, have become strategic partners and continue to strengthen close cooperation in all spheres. Partnership between our countries covers such spheres as trade, investment, exports and imports, fuel and energy complexes, the chemical industry, transport and logistics, the automotive industry, mining, light and the food industry, agriculture, information technologies and telecommunications, medicine, tourism, science and culture. The most-favored-nation treatment operates in the sphere of trade between our countries.The Republic of Korea has traditionally been a leading investment and technological partner in implementation of priority programs on diversifying and modernizing industry and infrastructure in Uzbekistan. Dozens of major projects have been implemented in various sectors of the economy, attracting investments of leading South Korean companies and banks of more than 7 billion dollars.The number of enterprises with South Korean capital in Uzbekistan is 461, including 75 with 100 percent Korean capital. These enterprises are operating mainly in the sphere of trade, oil and gas, the petrochemical and chemical industries, mining, engineering, the electrical and textile industries, information and communication technologies, transport and logistics, and tourism among others.Further strengthening of cooperation between the two countries is facilitated by consistently developing cultural and humanitarian ties. Higher education institutions of Uzbekistan are cooperating with more than 30 universities of South Korea. Departments of the Uzbek language have been established in the South Korean universities of foreign languages Daegu and Busan; the Korean language is being taught in the Uzbekistan State University of World Languages, the Tashkent State Institute of Oriental Studies and the Samarkand State Institute of Foreign Languages. The successful activity of Inha University in Tashkent is a vivid example of the prospects for partnership in the sphere of education.Close ties have been established at the municipal level, within the framework of which there are arrangements on cooperation between Tashkent and Seoul, Fergana and Yongin, Namangan and Seongnam, Samarkand and Gyeongju, and the Tashkent region and North Gyeongsang Province.The Republic of Korea is one of the leaders in the field of the introduction of e-government, as ranked every two years by the U.N. About 50 years ago, having begun to implement relevant projects, South Korea simultaneously carried out administrative reforms and the modernization of public administration, which was the guarantor of the effectiveness of the e-government system. This 'smart government' strategy is currently being implemented in the Republic of Korea. We are interested in developing cooperation in this sphere.Taking this opportunity, I would like to sincerely congratulate the peoples of Uzbekistan and South Korea on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. Our countries can be proud of the development dynamics of bilateral relations. I hope for their further strengthening and expansion in the future.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS (90%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (89%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (89%); CHEMICALS (88%); ASIAN STUDIES (78%); ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); ANNIVERSARIES (78%); MINE PLANNING & MANAGEMENT (77%); EXPORT TRADE (75%); IMPORT TRADE (75%); PETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTS (74%); UNITED NATIONS (74%); CHEMICALS TRADE (74%); PETROCHEMICALS (73%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (73%); COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (73%); CHEMICALS EXPORTS & IMPORTS (73%); MINING ENGINEERING (73%); ENGINEERING (73%); MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS (69%); FOOD INDUSTRY (69%); MINES & MINING (68%); CHEMICALS MFG (68%); PETROCHEMICALS INDUSTRY (68%); FOOD & BEVERAGE (68%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (67%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (67%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (67%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (62%); ETHNIC & CULTURAL STUDIES (62%); TEXTILES (50%)CITY: TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN (94%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (56%); TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (52%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (97%); UZBEKISTAN (97%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: August 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

One was ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? by Kim Hyong-o, a former National Assemblyman and house speaker. The other was ??Korea 4.0 Now?? by Kang Tae-jin, a professor of textile engineering and former dean at Seoul National University. While I was reading the two books, I could not but help nod frequently. Both books were well-argued, highly persuasive, penetrating and illuminating. Above all, they were thought-provoking and eye-opening. ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? argues that our political leaders have seriously lacked magnanimous leadership, that is, the capacity of embracing others, including their political opponents. Instead of embracing the differences, our leaders have almost always antagonized and turned their backs on those who do not belong to their faction, no matter how able and competent they are. Before appointing someone at a government post, our narrow-minded leaders have always asked, ??Is he one of us??? or ??Was he in our election camp??? Kim also argues that our social or political leaders have also lacked noblesse oblige, that is, the spirit of sacrifice, responsibility and decency that comes with privelege. In the eyes of the people, they just savor power bestowed upon them. But a true leader is one who is ready to sacrifice himself for people in an emergency. Unfortunately, our leaders have always disappointed us. When the Korean War broke out, our first president fled to the south, destroying the Han River Bridge as he left, so people could not escape from Seoul. The captain of the ill-fated Sewol abandoned his ship, leaving passengers to drown. When there was an earthquake, a school principal, instead of protecting or rescuing his students, reportedly escaped alone. ??For Whom This Nation Exists?? also laments our leaders?? clumsiness and incompetence in times of crisis. For example, when the Sewol sank or when the Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic spread, our leaders exhibited total incompetence. How can we trust and respect such inept leaders? Furthermore, no one assumes responsibility in Korean society when something happens. Kim also urges our political leaders to tear down the wall of collective selfishness and break the shell of factional antagonism. Indeed, our society urgently needs integration and reconciliation. After reading Kim??s insightful book, I hope that one day we all could sit at the table of reconciliation, singing together in unison and dancing joyously to peaceful music. The other book, ??Korea 4.0 Now,?? emphasizes the importance of convergence to integrate different academic disciplines such as engineering, medicine, education and the humanities. In the book, Kang encourages not only interdisciplinary, but also multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in academia that would enable us to have more sophisticated, comparative perspectives. The book calls for modern-day Renaissance men in Korean society. Kang also highlights that in order to accomplish true convergence and consilience, we should be creative. According to the book, creativity can be fostered by educational reform. Kang boldly argues that the binary evaluation system that forces students to choose the one and only right answer out of five possible answers should be abolished because it blocks diverse possibilities of creative thought. Kang says that so many revolutionary scientific discoveries inadvertently stem from random questions or what we perceive as wrong answers. In scientific terms, he writes, it is called ??serendipity.?? In ??Korea 4.0 Now,?? Kang contends that our future will be shaped by our excellence not only through creativity, but also artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, bioengineering, big data and other technologies that belong to the ??fourth industrial revolution.?? He urges that we should be prepared for the upcoming social change. In his book, Kang brings up an incident. At a G-20 summit meeting in 2010, Barack Obama repeatedly gave Korean reporters a chance to ask a question. Regrettably, no Korean reporters spoke at the time, whereas a Chinese reporter tried to ask questions several times. Kang blamed the Korean education that does not encourage people to ask questions. In my opinion, they could also have been silent because they were unsure of their English proficiency. Experts maintain that our English education has totally failed, because its main concern is not how to express yourself, but how to choose the grammatically right answer at the college entrance exam. If so, educational reform is imperative in Korea. After reading the two books, I pondered on the future of Korea. The two authors urge us to change. For example, we should put an end to populism, which is likely to make our nation bankrupt eventually, if pushed to the extreme. We should root out chronic factional brawls and unite. We should also try to change the future, not the past. In the movie ??Dragon Blade,?? Jackie Chan narrates, ??While cowards cling to the past, courageous men change the future.?? We, too, should become brave men who can change our future. Only then, will Korea??s future be bright.

A ministry official told the team that he had been ordered to tell them about issues among artists' groups.The team is looking into whether the agency's involvement in making the list constitutes an abuse of its authority.There are also allegations that the NIS had been monitoring the activities of leftist groups and reporting them to Cheong Wa Dae, which then added the groups to the list and handed it over to the ministry.Former Vice Culture Minister Cho Hyun-jae reportedly told the counsel team he had seen an NIS report which said 'control must be exercised over progressive culture and arts groups,' during his term from 2013 to 2014.Earlier this week, the team also raided the home of Lee Byung-ki, a former presidential chief of staff and former NIS chief. The team believes Lee, who served as chief of staff from February 2015 to May 2016 as Kim Ki-choon's successor, was also involved in the creation of the blacklist. Both Lee and Kim are expected to be summoned for questioning soon.Meanwhile, the team secured testimony from Kim So-young, a former presidential secretary for culture and sports, that Cheong Wa Dae's office of education and cultural affairs had drawn up the list which was then given to the culture ministry.This is the first testimony from someone within Cheong Wa Dae that acknowledges the presidential office's role in creating the blacklist.In addition, the team found the list not only contained progressive figures and entities but also those who were against plans pushing Choi's interests.In the meantime, the local daily Kyunghyang Shinmun reported poet Won Jae-hoon was removed from his position as a lecturer for a humanities program of a culture ministry-affiliated institution because he had voiced opposition to the Park administration's plan for the state-authored history textbook.The poet told the newspaper that the Publication Industry Promotion Agency of Korea explicitly told him he was cut due to his opposition to the plan.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); ESPIONAGE (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (77%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (77%); TEXTBOOKS (77%); SCANDALS (77%); LIBERALISM (77%); INTERROGATION OF SUSPECTS (77%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (76%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (72%); TEXT MESSAGING (72%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (72%); HISTORY (71%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (71%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (71%); WRITERS (63%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 4, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Blizzard Korea is set to invite six legend players for three 'StarCraft: Remastered' matches here on Sunday. The game will make its official debut on Aug. 15. / Courtesy of Blizzard'StarCraft: Remastered' will make its debut here this week, raising expectations over whether the ultra-high-definition (UHD) version of the real-time strategy game can continue the success of the original title.Blizzard Korea said Monday the game's limited 5,000 deluxe edition package, 'Complete Pack,' will be available for sale on Gwangalli Beach in the nation's southeastern port city of Busan, Sunday, before its official Aug. 15 debut.For Blizzard, Korea is one of the most important markets for the mega-hit game series. This is because the game has achieved unmatched success here, bringing forth such jobs as professional gamers and touching off a boom of internet cafes since the original version's debut in 1998.The game has since swept across the nation. Also notable is that it was not a one-time hit, but kept its popularity for more than a decade.Backed by this success, Blizzard released its second series, 'StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty,' in 2010. The title also made headlines in the initial stages, due to the strong intellectual property of its original version, leading to 'not-bad' sensations. But when compared with its predecessor, 'StarCraft II' was a de facto failure at least in the Korean market, as shown by weak popularity for its broadcasting competition leagues that drew little attention.To regain its luster, Blizzard Korea is set to hold a promotional event on the beach where legendary gamers hold matches.'Some of the famous professional gamers will have StarCraft: Remastered matches for the first time in Korea on Sunday,' a Blizzard Korea official said. 'The event, dubbed Good Game (GG) Together, will take place as part of our efforts to enjoy the moment with Korean fans who have supported 'StarCraft' for more than 19 years.'Players for the rival matches include those who are often dubbed the first-generation 'StarCraft' legends including Guillaume Patry and Kook Ki-bong, who enjoyed their heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s.The second match between Lim Yo-hwan and Hong Jin-ho is, however, expected to get the brightest limelight, as their rivalry drew a frenzy of excitement from fans during the early-to-mid 2000s. Yim is particularly cited as the most successful and iconic 'StarCraft' player in the world with the nickname the 'Terran Emperor.' Terran is one of the three species in the game, representing a fictional version of humanity.The final match will be between Lee Yoon-yeol and Park Jung-seok. Lee, who also plays as Terran, holds outstanding titles, winnng six major broadcasting competitions here - three from Korean tours and others from OnGameNet StarLeagues.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EVENT MARKETING (78%); BEACHES (69%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (50%)CITY: PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (56%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%)LOAD-DATE: July 28, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is the first biosimilar copy of Herceptin to obtain such backing in Europe.According to protocol, the European Commission is set to follow the EMA's opinion by issuing marketing approval in around two to three months, upon which Samsung Bioepis can begin selling Ontruzant in European markets. Samsung's partner Merck & Co. is set to take charge of the drug's marketing.The EMA's endorsement sets Samsung Bioepis on track to bringing the first biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) to Europe and challenging sales of Herceptin, which generated around $6.8 billion in global revenue for Roche in 2016.'We are proud to see Ontruzant become the first trastuzumab biosimilar recommended for approval in Europe, where breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer affecting women,ï'said Samsung Bioepis CEO Ko Han-sung. 'If approved, we hope Ontruzant will play an important role in expanding patient access to trastuzumab across the region,ï'Ko said.Samsung Bioepis is closely being followed by competitors, including Korea's Celltrion, Mylan and Biocon and Amgen and Allergan which have each submitted their own Herceptin copy for approval by the EMA. The EMA's backing of Ontruzant also signals a new feat for Samsung Bioepisï'drug pipeline, as it is the firm's first cancer-targeting drug to be close to regulatory approval.Samsung has so far secured approval for three biosimilar drugs in Europe, referencing Remicade, Enbrel and Humira. They are all anti-TNF therapies targeting autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.Friday's development also led local analysts to raise their target stock price for Samsung BioLogics, the parent company of Samsung Bioepis, on Monday. Shares of Samsung BioLogics hit an all-time high of 333,500 won ($300) before closing at 328,500 won on the day, up 0.61 percent from the previous trading day. ã€€Samsung Bioepis was founded in 2012 as a joint venture between contract drug manufacturer Samsung BioLogics and US drugmaker Biogen. Biogen holds a 5.4 percent stake in Bioepis, while Samsung BioLogics owns the remainder of the shares.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CANCER DRUGS (92%); BREAST CANCER (91%); ONCOLOGY (90%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (90%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (90%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (90%); CANCER (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); APPROVALS (89%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (86%); HOLDING COMPANIES (78%); ARTHRITIS (78%); PARENT COMPANIES (78%); PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (77%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (76%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (74%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (73%); JOINT VENTURES (73%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (69%); RHEUMATIC DISEASES (66%); GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (61%); STOCK PRICES (60%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (95%); ROCHE HOLDING AG (92%); MERCK & CO INC (69%); AMGEN INC (58%); ALLERGAN INC (58%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (58%); BIOCON LTD (54%)ORGANIZATION: EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (57%); EUROPEAN COMMISSION (57%)TICKER: ROG (SWX) (92%); MRK (PAR) (69%); MRK (NYSE) (69%); AMGN (NASDAQ) (58%); BIIB (NASDAQ) (58%); BIOCON (NSE) (54%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (95%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS325413 IN-VITRO DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCE MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (69%); SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS (69%); NAICS541715 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, & LIFE SCIENCES (EXCEPT NANOTECH & BIOTECH) (58%); SIC2836 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS, EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES (58%); NAICS333314 OPTICAL INSTRUMENT & LENS MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (58%)COUNTRY: EUROPE (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: October 11, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

The list goes on and on. Two of the five Korean films currently screening at the Cannes Film Festival are crime thrillers: ??The Merciless?? is about the precarious relationship between two criminals, while ??The Villainess?? centers on a ruthless assassin. Over on the small screen, ??Whisper?? focuses on a wrongly fired cop seeking revenge against the lawyers who framed her father for murder. The sci-fi drama ??Circle,?? which kicked off Monday, depicts detectives solving crimes in a dystopian world of controlled humanity. Primal instinct There are many reasons people are drawn, whether consciously or not, to stories of crime, psychologists say.?The first and simple reason is instinct, psychologist Kwak Geum-joo says. Despite our increasingly refined modern lives and the strengthening of laws, and no matter how mild-mannered a person may seem, all human beings harbor ??a primal instinct toward aggression and attack,?? she told The Korea Herald.?Some of the top box office hits in Korea have delved into the gruesome details of serial killings, such as Na Hong-jin??s 2008 thriller ??The Chaser?? and Bong Joon-ho??s 2003 film ??Memories of Murder.?? ???The truth is, crime flicks have always existed and always been popular,?? said Kwak. ??Grotesque crimes stoke our curiosity. We are drawn to them in spite of ourselves, due to our base nature.?? ?Another reason is that we feel a deep-seated sense of vicarious satisfaction while watching characters radically break the rules, Kwak added.? American psychologist Konrad Bresin, who specializes in abnormal psychology, implied in a 2013 study that a sort of healing, anger-reducing effect occurred through the release of aggression. ?On the other hand, some argue the thrill of watching terrible deeds could be the result of a defense mechanism.?In an article last year, criminology professor Scott Bonn argued that people ??receive a jolt of adrenaline as a reward for witnessing terrible deeds.??

While business people focus on predicting the next jackpot, designers, they can imagine how life would be in next 10 and 20 years,' said Aernout Dijkstra-Hellinga, design director of Bugaboo International, at a Design Talk session, hosted by Kim Sung-hyon, professor at Samsung Art & Design Institute, at the seventh annual Herald Design Forum held in Seoul on Tuesday.Seok Yong-bae, shoe design director and CEO of SEOK, thought of design thinking beyond its quintessential aesthetic function. 'There are so many elements in design, from promoting sales of products to the beauty and convenience of designs. For me, it's all connected,ï'Seok said. 'But if all industries can grow and sell more because of design, individuals working in companies can keep working, and sustain their lives, leading to their familiesï'happiness. Rather than be confined to the purpose of beauty or selling products, the fundamental thing is that a good design leads to better sales, leading to families sustaining their livelihood.ï'Seok went onto emphasize that separating the core of products and their fashionable parts is necessary to satisfy consumersï'needs, which leads to making enduring products. Carme Pigem, architect and co-founder of RCR Arquitectes, said expressing essential parts in life in abstract ways was her definition of design thinking. Dijkstra-Hellinga pointed out the need for a designer to have a sense of responsibility toward society and humanity in general. He said that designing should be based on communication and empathy toward others.'Designers are trained to cater to the needs of many people, and I think that's a rare quality. Design thinking is having the responsibility to think about how future would look like,ï'he said.

The launch of Samsung??s Remicade biosimilar, named Renflexis, comes three months after its official approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in April.Renflexis was developed by Songo-based Samsung Bioepis and is being commercialized in the US by its global sales marketing partner Merck & Co., known as MSD outside the US and Canada.Samsung??s Remicade biosimilar will be introduced in the US at a wholesale acquisition price of $753.39, which is 35 percent cheaper than the current listing price of Remicade, according to the two drugmakers.??Since we were established five years ago, we have striven to bring high-quality treatment options at a lower cost to US patients. Renflexis is our first step in meeting this important commitment,?? Samsung Bioepis President and CEO Ko Han-sung said in a statement.??We firmly believe biosimilars will play an instrumental role in making health care more accessible to patients across the US, and we will continue our relentless drive to advance one of the industry??s strongest pipelines.??J&J-owned Janssen, the developer of Remicade, has filed a lawsuit against Samsung Bioepis in the US, claiming that its biosimilar copy Renflexis infringes three of its patents related to Remicade??s manufacturing process. A hearing has yet to be scheduled.Samsung Bioepis has stated that Janssen??s moves were expected and that it did not infringe on Janssen??s patents.Renflexis is the second biosimilar referencing Remicade to be commercialized in the US, following Celltrion??s Inflectra, which hit the US market via Pfizer from November 2016. The introduction of Samsung??s Renflexis is slated to further eat into J&J??s Remicade sales as well as pose new competition to Celltrion??s Inflectra.For now, Renflexis appears to have a price advantage over Inflectra, though the latter has got an early start on sales. While Renflexis is priced at 35 percent cheaper than J&J??s Remicade, Celltrion??s Inflectra is priced 15 percent cheaper than the original drug.Samsung Bioepis already sells multiple biosimilars in global markets in addition to Renflexis, which has won approval in Europe, Australia and Korea. Its Enbrel biosimilar was the first of its kind to hit Australia, Canada, Korea and Europe.Its biosimilar copy of Humira, Imraldi, was recommended for approval by the European Medicines Agency??s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in June. Its Herceptin biosimilar is currently under review by the EMA. Founded in 2012, Samsung Bioepis is a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics and US-based Biogen with the former holding a 91.2 percent stake.

Chicago's is tough and tender. Gangster and Midwestern. Violent and benevolent. Chicago is the Great Fire of 1871. It is the World's Columbian Exposition 22 years later, lusty and industrious. It is Hull House. It is jazz. It is 'The Blues Brothers.' It is the bootstrap of the first African-American U.S. president.But Chicago has another enduring if underappreciated story.The summer of 2018 will mark the 50th anniversary of Special Olympics, an organization with deep Chicago roots that is now the largest sporting competition in the world for intellectually disabled children and adults. What began as an idea for a simple track-and-field event at Soldier Field branched into a global community serving 4.9 million athletes in 172 countries. The 2019 summer games will be held in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.The rise of Special Olympics during the last 50 years represented more than a popular sporting event. It marked the beginning of a shift in humanity. Disabled children and adults, often abandoned, institutionalized and isolated, joined mainstream society. They were seen. They were celebrated. Countries that once confined the disabled to prisonlike conditions have now embraced and even hosted the games.That worldwide culture change launched, slowly, with a partnership that included Eunice Kennedy Shriver of the Kennedy family foundation, now-Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Chicago Park District.Burke, who was teaching physical education classes to disabled children at the Park District, wanted to reach more students. She saw how recreation programs changed them, challenged them, encouraged them. She approached city officials with the idea of a citywide track meet.A natural partner, the Kennedy family with Shriver leading the way had championed the needs of the disabled community. President John F. Kennedy had prioritized care for the disabled with federal funding and numerous acts of Congress to expand opportunities for this population. With the resources and enthusiasm of Mayor Daley, the Kennedys, Burke and the Park District, the first Special Olympics unfolded at Soldier Field in July 1968. Athletes from 26 states and Canada participated in the 50-yard dash, 300-yard run, field hockey, swimming and jumping.A Chicago Tribune story published July 21, 1968, quoted Shriver: 'The Chicago Special Olympics proves retarded children can be exceptional athletes; that thru (sic) sports they can realize their potential for growth. But they are only 1,000 out of 1.5 million mentally retarded children who should be given a chance to compete in games like this all over America. Our purpose here today is to secure a pledge that all retarded children will be given this chance in the future.'Special Olympics Chicago has since helped establish programs for disabled children in more than 120 Chicago public schools and parks across the city. The worldwide 50th anniversary celebration is planned for July 17-21 in Chicago. A soccer game, sports activities, concerts and a torch run are among the expected events.The anniversary will become part of Chicago's story, too _ another chapter in its role establishing a new era for the disabled. Special Olympics might not be as legendary to Chicago as 'The Blues Brothers' or two World's Fairs (the 1933-4 Century of Progress International Exposition included) or even the Cubs or deep-dish pizza. But there's no question Special Olympics arguably has had a far greater impact on the world around us.For that, Chicago should be proud.The article appeared in the Chicago Tribune (www.chicagotribune.com).

"76","The time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","The time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine   THE KOREA HERALD December 18, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 18, 2017 MondayThe time has come for Koreans to invest in Ukraine LENGTH: 1590 wordsThis article was contributed by the Embassy of Ukraine. - Ed.What do Koreans know about Ukraine? Perhaps, some still remember a breathtaking triumph of a Ukrainian athlete Sehii Bubka at 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Those into football probably know Andrii Shevchenko, a 'Golden Ball' winner and legendary striker for Milan and Chelsea. Some Koreans probably think of Ukraine as a mysterious country in Europe, with the most beautiful women in the world. Of course, there is a lot more to Ukraine waiting for Korean people to discover. Take, for example, Ukrainiansï'constant aspirations to reach far beyond Earth. Starting with George Gamow, born in Odesa, who proposed a physical model of the Universe origins known as the 'Big Bang,ï'and continuing with a first turbo-jet engine that was developed by a Ukrainian scientist Arkhip Lyulka from Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Ukraine has always been at the forefront of the world's most cutting-edge airplane and space program efforts. Everyone in the world knows about a titanic Antonovâ€‘225 Mriya airplane, originally developed for the space program. The airplane can lift record-breaking 253,800 kg and is nowadays used for super heavy cargo transportation.Another Ukrainian who truly deserves recognition as a front-runner of human space exploration is Sergei Korolev. Born and grew up in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, Korolev is sometimes referred to as the 'father of modern astronautics.ï'He engineered and made possible the launch of the first satellite Sputnik, as well as the first human being in space.Down on Earth, Ukrainians worked hard to advance humanity into technological era. Numerous fundamental discoveries in physics, mathematics, medicine, electronics have been made by Ukrainian scientists. Ukrainians have pioneered in computers industry, both hardware and software. MESM, the first computer in Europe, was built in Kyiv in 1948. As computers became more popular, Ukrainians made technology more accessible for people. For example, Ukrainian company PocketBook is one of the world's largest manufacturers of electronic readers based on the E Ink ('electronic paper') technology. World-famous software companies, such as PayPal and WhatsApp, and many others, have Ukraine-born founders.But what if we turn around, and explore what does an average Ukrainian know about Korea? One of Four Asian Tigers, the Miracle on Han River, the home of world-famous innovators such as Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and global events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics 2018. Perhaps, considering that Ukraine's national football team did not qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup, many Ukrainians will cheer for the Korean national team. Ukrainians welcome and enjoy Korean traditional culture, its food, music, fashion and architecture. Popular Korean restaurants in Kyiv serve authentic Korean food and drinks. K-Pop stars visit Kyiv for concerts, gathering huge crowds. Ukrainian TV channels broadcast Korean drama for Ukraine's 45 million strong audience. Kyiv residents spend their weekends at a recently opened Korean traditional garden, immersing themselves into a Korean spirit.Ukrainians know that the advances of Korean society are hard-earned. Thanks to the unbreakable spirit of the Korean people, the country could fight Japanese occupation and communists, rising from the ashes of Korean War into one of the most developed countries in the world. Ukrainian people can relate to Korea, because they also suffered from occupation by its powerful neighbor. Korean media have echoed the news from Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. The government of the Republic of Korea expressed serious concerns over these developments in Ukraine, and stated that Korea will not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea (2014.03.19 MOFA Spokesperson's Statement on the Situation in Ukraine).Clearly, in the age of information technology warfare, the so-called 'hybrid wars,ï'it requires insurmountable amount of efforts and collective stand up to the aggressor. Take, for example, the spread of 'fake news.'Everybody knows that Yuzhnoye design office and Yuzhmash, world's leading manufacturers of space rockets, are in a full compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. The companies have a long standing and well-documented history of directly supporting the US government efforts in non-proliferation since the 90's. Also, the European Vega light-class launch vehicle was made in Ukraine, and was successfully launched from the Kourou Space Centre (French Guiana) on Aug. 2 delivering two satellites for the Israel Aerospace Industries into orbits. Since the Vega program began, Ukraine has helped deliver 25 satellites into space, for 19 customers. In fact, just on Nov. 12, Yuzhnoye and Yuzhmash helped launch a modernized launcher 'Antaresï'from the Space Flight Facility on the Wallops Island, Virginia, successfully delivering cargo to the International Space Station. Twenty-five years ago, in 1992, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea was opened in Kyiv. Soon after, the Embassy of Ukraine began its activities in Seoul. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our states, we have made considerable efforts to build deep cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Air and SpaceAs already mentioned, Ukraine is famous for its aerospace engineering industry, as it possesses a full cycle of aerospace hardware engineering and production. At the same time, Korea aspires to become a space nation, and recently succeeded in its advance into space. In fact, Korea Aerospace Research Institute and Yuzhnoye design office have already cooperated on the launch services: From 2013-2015, Dnepr rockets successfully delivered Korean satellites to orbit. Another legendary Ukrainian airspace company is Antonov. The company has designed over 100 passenger, cargo and special purpose airplanes, with over 22,000 of them used by 55 countries around the world. With more than 70 years of experience in airplane design, engineering, manufacturing, sales and even operation, it is ready to work with Korean partners to open a new era in aviation. Co-developing a brand-new NATO-compliant An-148 marine patrol airplane, and even delivery of super large cargo using record-breaking An-124 'Ruslanï'and An-225 'Mriyaï'-- all of these opportunities are fully available to Korea. In addition, in order to fully replace Russia-produced parts of its An-148, An-158, An-132 and An-70 airplanes, Antonov is open to consider Korean-manufactured parts and systems for its products.For over 70 years Ivchenko-Progress design bureau is developing and manufacturing aviation gas turbine engines for a wide range of purposes and applications, such as ground use or aviation. The scientific and technical potential and experimental research complex of Ivchenko-Progress SE allows developing turbo-jet engines of various types with a thrust of 500-50,000 kilonewtons and a power of 300-15,000 horsepower. The company is open to cooperation with Korean partners who are interested in turbine engines. AgricultureUkraine has long been called the 'breadbasket of Europeï'for its fertile black soil, perfect climate and landscapes for agriculture. Korean companies are actively participating in development of Ukraine's agricultural potential. For example, Posco Daewoo and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food will jointly upgrade agricultural machines in Ukraine for small and medium farms. The company will also construct grain elevators in Ukrainian ports, as grain exports continue to be a very popular commodity in international markets. The potential of Ukraine's agriculture, however, is far from being fulfilled, so Korean agritech and agriculture companies are more than welcome to explore possibilities in Ukraine and take advantage of world's most fertile soils.TechnologyKorean companies are successfully developing and selling their products in Ukraine. For example, Samsung Electronics operates an R&D center that employs more than 1,000 Ukrainians. Ukraine, on the other hand, is a leading software engineering country, with total market value over $2 billion. Ukrainian software engineers are among the best in the world. This year, Korean National IT Promotion Agency selected Ukrainian-founded Cards out of over 1,500 worldwide for 'K-Startup Grand Challenge 2017,ï'a governmental support program. Cards is developing 'andCards,ï'a software service that helps foster networking culture and build community at coworking centers.The time has never been better to invest into Ukraine, and to cooperate with the Ukrainian companies. Asian investors have already been actively investing into Ukraine. For example, Japanese electric equipment manufacturer Fujikura is already opening its second factory in Ukraine. Chinese construction companies are building ports and metro lines all around Ukraine. Various Chinese companies already invested over $7 billion into Ukraine. Tempered by the past, both Korea and Ukraine are emerging as a new type of nations: more united, competitive and creative. Passionate about technology, and rooted into tradition, both countries can combine their best achievements of past and present to reach extraordinary heights. The time has come for Korean businesses and investments to come to Ukraine, to work with Ukraine, and to create new growth engines between our countries.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); OLYMPICS (90%); SPACE EXPLORATION (90%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (89%); SOCCER (89%); SPORTS AWARDS (89%); COMPUTER EQUIPMENT (86%); SPORTS & RECREATION (83%); SUMMER OLYMPICS (77%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (77%); ASTRONOMY & SPACE (75%); AEROSPACE RESEARCH (73%); SPACE INDUSTRY (72%); 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS (72%); WINTER SPORTS (72%); ELECTRONICS (68%); SOFTWARE MAKERS (67%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (67%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (61%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (60%); RESTAURANTS (60%); POP & ROCK (60%); FIFA WORLD CUP (60%); WINTER OLYMPICS (57%)COMPANY: PAYPAL INC (52%)INDUSTRY: NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE & CLEARINGHOUSE ACTIVITIES (52%); SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES (52%); SIC6099 FUNCTIONS RELATED TO DEPOSITORY BANKING, NEC (52%)CITY: KIYEV, UKRAINE (92%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); ODESSA, UKRAINE (79%)STATE: EARTH (79%)COUNTRY: UKRAINE (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); EUROPE (90%)LOAD-DATE: December 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"77","Syrian bloodshed enters 7th year",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"April","Syrian bloodshed enters 7th year  Korea Times April 7, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesApril 7, 2017 FridaySyrian bloodshed enters 7th yearBYLINE: By John J. MetzlerLENGTH: 780 wordsUNITED NATIONS - Syria's bloody conflict has entered its seventh year with unrelenting killings, displacements and bombardments being 'one of the largest man-made humanitarian and protection crises in the world.' As the UN Humanitarian Chief Stephen O'Brien told the Security Council, 'Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and million more injured.' He stressed, 'Over five million people have fled and are now living as refugees.'In yet another impassioned address begging for humanitarian access to besieged towns, O'Brien lamented, 'Crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by all parties time and time again.' He added, 'Syrians have watched huge parts of their historic and proud country reduced to rubble.'As American UN Ambassador Nikki Haley advised, 'Half of all Syrians are displaced from their homes, some living in the ruins of bombed out buildings and others fleeing as refugees to neighboring countries. At this point, two-thirds of Syria's remaining population, those who have not crossed international borders, require some form of aid.'Think for a moment of the dire images of shattered lives and battered buildings in historic cities such as Aleppo, Homs and even the ancient capital Damascus. The pulverized towns and the tragic refugee streams. The lost hopes of toppling the Assad regime replaced not by a dream of democracy but a living nightmare of violent jihadi terrorist organizations such as Al-Nusra or the Islamic State/Daesh.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been visiting the Mid-East and touring the swelling refugee camps in places like Jordan. As the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Guterres visited this camp far too many times. Yet the numbers of refugees from neighboring Syria have only grown.Secretary-General Guterres stated firmly that this is not a tragedy'only for the Syrian people but it became a threat to the stability of the region and a global security threat to the world as terrorism is benefiting from the crisis in Syria, and several other crises around the world.'He warned, 'This is the moment for all countries that are involved, directly or indirectly in the conflict, to put aside their differences and understand that now there is a common interest and the common interest from the fact that they are all threatened by the new risk of global terrorism.'Peace talks among many parties to the conflict have droned on in Geneva but have failed to reach a serious political breakthrough to stop the fighting.Addressing the Arab League in Amman, Jordan the Secretary General warned, 'Divisions in the Arab world have opened the door to foreign intervention and manipulation, breeding instability, sectarian strife and terrorism.'Guterres cautioned, 'Too many people have fallen into the trap of presenting the despicable acts of Da'esh or Al-Qaida as driven by Islam, when, in fact, they utterly defy the faith. Indeed Muslims themselves are the primacy victims.'As this column has often opined, the Syrian civil war mirrors the Spanish Civil war of 1936-1939. The conflict has become a 'cause celebre' for radical Islamists the world over who view Syria as a rallying point. Indeed much like the International Brigades of Spain almost 80 years ago, today radicals from Europe, North Africa, Afghanistan and even the USA have flocked to Syria to join thousands of foreign fighters keeping the conflict's cauldron boiling.Equally as with the Spanish civil war which attracted the intervention and political interference of Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy, here too in Syria we see the powers and their proxies such as Russia, Islamic Iran and the U.S. and Britain. And tragically the UN Security Council is dangerously deadlocked with both Moscow and Beijing blocking significant resolutions.So what is to be done? First; Offer extra humanitarian support both to UN operations inside Syria and to the countries hosting huge numbers of refugees such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey.Second, Saudi Arabia and the rich Gulf states can and should do more to help their brother Arabs from Syria by resettlement plans. These are people of the same language, culture and religion.Third; U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has stressed 'Stabilization zones,' or Safe Zones so Syrians do not have to flee far from their country but will be safe. Implement these soon.The scourge of Syria's civil war has continued for far too long. We must solve Syria now.John J. Metzler is a United Nations correspondent covering diplomatic and defense issues.

Last month, he was appointed to the International Football Association Board's (IFAB) Football Advisory Panel (FAP). Representing the AFC, Park will advise the board regarding rule changes in the sport.He returned to Korea last month after completing the FIFA Master Course, a sports management program coordinated by the International Centre for Sports Studies and endorsed by FIFA. He had an interview with the Hankook Ilbo, the sister paper of The Korea Times, Thursday.In the interview, the 36-year-old talked about his life after retirement and gave some insightful advice to the sluggish Korean national football team struggling for qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.Q: How long has it been since you were in Korea?A: This is my first visit to Korea since I enrolled in the FIFA Master Course, so it has taken a year for me to return.Q: We've heard that your daughter is now three years old.A: Yes, in Korean age, she is three years old. More accurately, she is 21 months old.Q: Do you actively take part in parenting?A: When I was studying at the FIFA Master Course, I was always with her except when I had to be in school from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I used to hang out with my daughter and bathe her with my wife.Q: When you were a football player, you were not active in communicating with your fans via social media and never made TV appearances except for football-related programs. Now that you are retired, do you see any change in that?A: I've heard Patrice Evra (former Manchester United player and Park's friend) became enormously famous through Instagram and made some additional profit from it. But I think I am not that type of person. I have changed my mind on TV appearances somewhat. Of course, I don't want fame or to make money by appearing on TV, but I would not mind appearing on TV if it is related to what I am doing for football.While completing the FIFA Master Course, Park studied sports humanities at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, for four months; sports management at SDA Bocconi School of Management in Milan, Italy, for three months; and sports law at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland for three months.Q: Among the three courses, which part did you like most?A: Every course was helpful for me. At first, I discovered my interest in sports management. I thought the sports law sector would be boring, but it was unexpectedly interesting.Q: What else would you like to study?A: Again? (Park shook his head.) As a matter of fact, I was asked to finish another sports-related course, but I turned that down. Now I want to have practical work experience based on what I've learned.Q: Are you thinking about working for the Korea Football Association (KFA)?A: It's possible, but I would like to find a job in Europe. As Europe is more advanced in football administration, I would like to learn more there.Speaking of the Korean national football team, Park emphasized that building trust among team members is the most important part. After taking the World Cup qualifying loss to Qatar, the KFA sacked the national team coach Uli Stielike in June and appointed Shin Tae-yong, the former under-20 national football team coach, as the new head coach last month. Korea currently ranks second with 13 points in Group A. For automatic qualification for next year's World Cup, the team needs to have at least one win and one draw in its remaining matches. Korea will play Iran at home, Aug. 31, and an away match against Uzbekistan, Sept. 5.Q: What are the odds Korea will make the World Cup?A: 50 percent? (Park laughs.) I think the fact that the Korean national football team has to play against strong teams is more positive for Korea. Players will have extra motivation and this will have a positive effect on them. It is fortunate that the team plays Iran at home but we are not good against Uzbekistan in an away match. (Korea's last win against Uzbekistan in an away match was in October, 1997.) I think Korea can make World Cup after defeating Iran at home and collecting a draw against Uzbekistan.Q: What do you think is the biggest problem of the Korean national football team?A: Some say the players are too lazy or there are factional disputes in the team, but I don't think there is only one problem. There are tiny little issues in the team that add up to a big problem. The most important thing is how much they believe in each other. After all, it is the players who have to solve the issue.Q: Are you saying it is the players who hold the answer?A: Even if the team changes its coach, it is the players who have to accept that and take action. It is players who can gain the most from a change in the coaching staff.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: OLYMPICS (91%); WINTER SPORTS (91%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (90%); SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES (90%); SOCCER (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION (90%); 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS (90%); WINTER OLYMPICS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); SPORTS (90%); ATHLETES (78%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (78%); SPORTS AGENTS & PROMOTERS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); SPORTS BUSINESS (78%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (78%); FIFA WORLD CUP (77%); PARENTING (67%); SOCIAL MEDIA (60%)COMPANY: MANCHESTER UNITED PLC (57%)ORGANIZATION: FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION (82%)TICKER: MANU (NYSE) (57%)INDUSTRY: NAICS711211 SPORTS TEAMS & CLUBS (57%); SIC7941 PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS & PROMOTERS (57%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (97%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: August 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

He said people will still need to learn foreign languages in the future to make genuine and human communication.'I'm skeptical about the idea that machine translation will replace all translations that have been done by humans,' Hagiwara said in a recent interview with The Korea Times in Seoul. 'No matter how much technology will be advanced, learning foreign languages is essential for true communication between humans who have different mother tongues.'Hagiwara said machine translations have greatly improved thanks to the introduction of new mechanisms such as neural networks, which mimic the structure human brain. With the rapid advancement of computer sciences to make machines process and use human languages, people will be able to learn a foreign language more efficiently, he said.'Even those who know only a bit of a foreign language may improve their language skills by using wearable devices like Google Glass or a tiny chip that can be implanted in human body in the future,' he said.Hagiwara said natural language processing technology is a key interface that connects machine's languages and human languages and enables dialogue between the two.'Besides machine translation services, messenger service providers such as LINE are increasingly using this technology for chatbot services,' he said.Hagiwara acquired his doctoral degree in software engineering at Nagoya University. He can also speak Chinese, Japanese and English fluently. Tapping into his linguistic and technological expertise, Hagiwara is working to build the Japanese course for English speakers on Duolingo.Before Duolingo, he worked at many major IT companies around the globe including Google, Microsoft, Baidu and Rakuten.Hagiwara visited Korea for talks at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Naver Research about the role of big data in foreign language education.Duolingo is a free foreign language learning platform available both on computer web browsers and mobile devices. It allows users to learn foreign languages through quick translation, composition and reading questions while evaluating their own language skills.As of November 2016, Duolingo offer courses for 23 languages including English, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese and Korean. It has about 150 million users across the world.Based on diverse computer science technologies including natural language processing, Duolingo's adaptive system is designed to evaluate the users' language skills and give them questions accordingly.The company also combined this system to the European Union's common European framework of reference for languages and devised what is called the Duolingo English Test (DET). This paid test provides qualification for scores which can be submitted to colleges or enterprises in North America to certify language skills. Harvard University also acknowledges the DET as a skill certificate, he said.'We have focused on North and South American markets. But as we understand that Asian markets, especially in China, Japan and Korea, many students are more than eager to get their language skills certified,' he said. 'We seek to expand in this area, too.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TRANSLATORS & INTERPRETERS (93%); MACHINE TRANSLATION (93%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (92%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (92%); TECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS (90%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (90%); ENGINEERING (90%); LANGUAGE ACQUISITION (90%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (89%); SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & ENGINEERING (89%); COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (89%); NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (89%); COMPUTER ENGINEERING (89%); COMPUTER PROGRAMMING (89%); CHATBOTS (78%); COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (78%); WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY (78%); COMPUTER SCIENCE (78%); LINGUISTICS (78%); APPLIED LINGUISTICS (78%); WEARABLE COMPUTERS (77%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (75%); CERTIFICATES  DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (75%); MOBILE DEVICES (69%); CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (67%); INTERVIEWS (66%)COMPANY: GOOGLE INC (85%); MICROSOFT CORP (51%)TICKER: MSFT (NASDAQ) (51%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (85%); NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS (51%); SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE (51%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)STATE: PENNSYLVANIA, USA (73%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); UNITED STATES (73%)LOAD-DATE: August 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

But it still has faced strong objections from opposition parties and civic groups, arguing that Tokyo has yet to offer a sincere apology for its wrongdoings conducted during the 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea.The country's leading presidential contenders, including Moon Jae-in from the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung, have called for a reassessment of the accord.The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Tokyo is one of the Park administration's key policies that is likely to be reviewed.The military intelligence-sharing pact ? signed in November last year ? has stirred up a strong backlash from opposition parties and civic groups, who accused the Park government of pushing for it despite the then growing calls for Park to step aside from all state affairs due to the corruption scandal involving Park and her long-time friend Choi Soon-sil.They also blamed the current government for unilaterally striking the deal without considering public sentiment against Japan's unrepentant views towards its atrocities before and during World War II. Seoul and Tokyo resumed the controversial talks in November last year after a four-year hiatus, and it took less than a month to conclude the deal.The Park government's controversial state-authored history textbooks for middle and high schools could also be abolished.The 'right-leaning' textbooks have faced fierce opposition from liberal historians for containing definitions and interpretations of historical events skewed in favor of conservatives.An official from the main opposition DPK said the abolition of the book will be a 'top priority for the new education minister under the new government,' considering a high possibility of the opposition bloc taking power. The opposition parties expect the textbook to be scrapped within three months after the early presidential election.The reopening of an industrial park that was jointly run with North Korea may be reconsidered.Park's government closed the Gaeseong complex last year following a nuclear test and long-range rocket launch by the North.The Constitutional Court upheld a parliamentary vote to impeach Park over the scandal, Friday, leading to an early presidential election, likely to be on May 9.Park was found to have broken the law by allowing her friend Choi to meddle in state affairs, thus breaching rules on public servants' activities. 'Park's breaching of the constitution and the laws betrayed the trust of the people,' said Constitutional Court chief justice Lee Jung-Mi, describing her actions as 'a serious and unacceptable violation of the laws.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); POLITICS (90%); SLAVERY (90%); AGREEMENTS (90%); HISTORY (89%); ELECTIONS (89%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (89%); WORLD WAR II (89%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (89%); TEXTBOOKS (88%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (78%); SCANDALS (78%); LIBERALISM (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); CORRUPTION (77%); CONSERVATISM (77%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (74%); SPACE EXPLORATION (74%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); IMPEACHMENT (73%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (72%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (72%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (70%); INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY (67%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (67%); HIGH SCHOOLS (62%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (62%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%); MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: TOKYO, JAPAN (90%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (72%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (72%)LOAD-DATE: March 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Kimchi is an inextricable part of Korean cuisine. It is a side dish made from vegetables seasoned and fermented with various condiments such as red pepper powder, garlic and ""jeotgal"" (salted seafood).It has been a staple on Korean dining tables, with origins dating back to the early period of the Three Kingdoms (37 B.C.-7 A.D.). Historically, kimchi has evolved to feature various local ingredients. As seen in early records, kimchi did not originally use garlic or chili pepper. Chili pepper is now a common ingredient of the vegetable dish, but it was introduced to Korea in the early 17th century by Portuguese traders.The CHA said kimchi-making encompasses the sense of community and fellowship such as cooperation and harmony and includes traditional knowledge.""The tradition also has been passed down through the generations, still exists and many Koreans take part in kimchi-making routinely, so we decided kimchi-making is recognizable as an intangible cultural heritage,"" the CHA said.When gimjang made the UNESCO list, the collective practice was credited for reaffirming ""Korean identity and is an excellent opportunity for strengthening family cooperation"" and ""also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.""However, the CHA said kimchi-making is more of a lifestyle and does not require a high degree of skills, so they will not acknowledge specific holders or organizations of the intangible heritage.""We will research and document to discover the cultural value of kimchi-making,"" the CHA said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (94%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); HOME FOOD PRESERVATION (75%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: November 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

But I also think Netflix??s principle of simultaneous streaming should be respected. ??Okja?? has been made with the subscription fees of Netflix viewers and we cannot tell them to wait until after (the movie) has screened in theaters. I respect that.???Bong also assumed responsibility for the kerfuffle in Korea. ??I think (this situation) has arisen from my cinematic greed. Netflix hasn??t tried to push through with theatrical releases (abroad) but Korea is a unique case. That is because of me. While filming with (cinematographer Darius Khondji), we wanted as many people as possible in the US, UK and Korea to be able to see the film on the big screen. It was my greed.???Bong expressed hope that necessary regulations and systems would be put in place as a result of this controversy. ???I think this film arrived too early, before the rules have been put in place. I hope it will mark the first firing shot of (the implementation) of relevant rules.???Korea??s largest cinema chain CGV has refused to screen the film, while Lotte Cinema and Megabox are still deliberating. However, a number of smaller, independent theaters throughout the country, including Seoul??s Daehan Cinema and Seoul Cinema, have agreed to carry ??Okja,?? a decision which Bong welcomed.??It??s an opportunity to visit theaters we??ve forgotten for a while. I??m satisfied with the current situation,?? he said. ??I hope (the film) will be able to meet you for a long time, even if in fewer places.?? ?Bong??s latest creature feature tells the story of country girl Mija on a quest to rescue the gigantic super-pig Okja. It is set to hit a handful of local theaters and Netflix??s international streaming platform on June 29. Multiculturalism, optimism and humanity in ??Okja??A number of the film??s cast members, also present at the press event, spoke about what the project had meant to them.?Korean-American Steven Yeun, who stars as radical animal-rights activist K, said filming had been a ??surreal?? experience. K is also a Korean-American character who acts as translator within the film??s multi-ethnic ensemble. ??I literally played K and was K during the film. I??m from (Korea) but I need a translator. ... And in America, there??s the perception that someone who looks like me is not necessarily from there. It??s a lonely middle line that I share with all the immigrants in America.??(The film) told a unique experience that hasn??t been conveyed in this way before.?? ? According to British actress Tilda Swinton, who stars as psychopathic CEO Lucy Miranda, the film suggested optimism for human growth.???(There are) two young creatures at the heart of the film. In many ways it is about growing up. It suggests that when we grow up, we don??t have to give up love, the sense of family, trusting each other, (and) the idea that it??s possible not to tell lies ... and survive.???Giancarlo Esposito, who stars as a top associate in the Mirando corporation, said the film was about ??wonder and enchantment?? for him.???Visionary movies allow you to... look deeper inside yourself, and how you want to be toward the world around you.???There??s hope, reverence for the grand architect of the universe who created this wonderful space for us to play in.?????We live in an exhausting world that centers on money,?? said Bong. ??I think (Mija and Okja) show something that cannot be destroyed even today.?? Why a girl, why a pig? Asked why the main protagonist is a young girl, Bong replied, ??I think it??s so much more beautiful when little girls show strength, than little boys.???Ahn Seo-hyun, 13, who portrayed the headstrong Mija, had immediately understood that she was to be the caretaker of the huge creature Okja upon reading the script, Bong said.?The decision to make many of the central characters female, including Okja, was a natural one, Bong said. ??I didn??t come at it from a feminist perspective but as the story came together, I realized the main axes had to be women.?? ?While Okja is a genetic hybrid of an elephant, a hippo and a pig, Bong made her a pig because of what the animal stood for in the food industry.???When you look at a pig, you think of food, which I think must be unfair for the pig, which is actually a very clean, beautiful and intelligent creature.???There??s no other animal that symbolizes the duality of animals so well -- their beauty and their food status,?? said Bong. ?By Rumy Doo (doo@heraldcorp.com) From left: Byun Hee-bong, Tilda Swinton, Ahn Seo-hyun, Steven Yeun, Giancarlo Esposito, Daniel Henshall and Bong Joon-hoLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FILM (91%); STREAMING MEDIA (90%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); MOVIE & VIDEO PRODUCTION (90%); MOVIE THEATERS (89%); VISUAL ARTISTS (89%); MOVIE FILMING (79%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (78%); FILM FESTIVALS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (77%); FESTIVALS (77%); CINEMATOGRAPHY (73%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS (73%); THEATER (59%)COMPANY: NETFLIX INC (92%)TICKER: NFLX (NASDAQ) (92%)INDUSTRY: NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE & DISC RENTAL (92%); SIC7841 VIDEO TAPE RENTAL (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); UNITED STATES (90%); FRANCE (90%)LOAD-DATE: June 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"85","[Robert Park] President Moon: Please effectually abolish human trafficking",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"October","[Robert Park] President Moon: Please effectually abolish human trafficking   THE KOREA HERALD October 31, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 31, 2017 Tuesday[Robert Park] President Moon: Please effectually abolish human trafficking LENGTH: 1257 words'Among our institutions and customs there are things so atrocious that nobody can legitimately feel himself innocent of this diffused complicity. It is certain that each of us is involved at least in the guilt of criminal indifference.'- Simone Weil (1909-1943)'The death penalty, corporal punishment and public prostitution will be abolished.' - Constitution, Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (1919)Human trafficking is a unique category of evil. Deploying multifarious stratagems -- while typically preying upon the young, neediest and most disenfranchised within society -- abhorrent people-peddlers lie in wait, methodically orchestrating the enslavement of human beings. Their victims bear the image of God -- who intended for all to be free.ã€€While I remain a committed opponent of the death penalty -- the New Testament categorically prohibits it -- an atrocity, widely reported within Korea currently has shaken that conviction.ã€€The perpetrator, surnamed Lee, was apprehended for slaying a 14-year-old girl after exploiting the child for some unutterably heinous misdeed. The lecherous 35-year-old was a pimp, pornographer and sex trafficker with a penchant for child victims. Lee also inflicted extreme cruelties against his now-deceased wife, forcing her into prostitution and videotaping the rapes, which he then sold -- abusing ignominious websites that must be permanently eliminated. The trauma drove the woman to suicide.ã€€The man led a lavish lifestyle with ill-gotten donations -- amounting to $1.15 million -- through which he procured several foreign cars, according to local reports.Bereaved of her mother, Lee's 14-year-old daughter -- whose friend was the murder victim -- was doubtlessly diabolically manipulated and pressed by him to entrap his teenage victim.ã€€To cite 'intellectual disabilityï'in Lee's defense is wrong, wholly misplaced and pathetic. Lee was intelligent enough to swindle inordinate amounts of money from an unsuspecting public, to efficiently run trafficking rings enslaving human lives and shrewdly utilize social media toward these ends, all while living a life of luxury. Lee must be punished most severely. In doing so, South Korea must communicate an unambiguous anti-trafficking stance and ultimatum to traffickers across the nation (and world): Discontinue these outrages or perish.ã€€He hunted teenagers with vomit-inducing 'adsï'aimed at ensnaring '14-20 year-oldsï'into toiling at his unlawful 'massage parlorï'-- which allegedly peddled in child prostitution. There are reported to be others like him still at-large -- they need to be apprehended. ã€€President Moon, please, in the name of humanity, order no-nonsense raids of such 'massage parlorsï'in Korea, many of which reportedly are thinly masked brothels facilitating such crimes. For the love of humanity, please eradicate sex trafficking and child prostitution from this land and the Korean people -- both North and South -- forevermore.Thousands of North Korean refugees in China have also been sex trafficked and are suffering unbearable violations. Please assist and intercede for them. 'Now is the time to face up to the pain people had to endure, which was caused by the nation's failure to protect its people,ï'as was stated in your Aug. 15 address. ã€€The UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's human rights situation concluded 'a large percentage of women and girls who cross the border from the DPRK (North Korea) to China unaccompanied become victims of trafficking ... for purposes of exploitation in forced marriage and forced concubinage. A number of women and girls are also forced to work in prostitution.ï'The Commission ascertained that 'traffickers systematically target DPRK women, who are usually hungry and desperate.ï''China's refoulement practice and the DPRK's torture and punishment of repatriated persons effectively render victims without protection,ï'their 2014 investigative report determined. Some 30,000 children have been born to these trafficked refugees -- routinely involving savage rapes -- and 'because registering their birth would expose the mother's status,ï'and owing to the ever-present menace of refoulement in China, these Korean children are 'effectively rendered stateless.ï'Consequently, such innocent victims likewise are prone to sadistic people traffickers. ã€€Securing a unified homeland where repatriated refugees and their children would never be tortured, providing for these Koreans and their young ones a safe haven where they could rebuild their lives without worrying about being trafficked, raped or otherwise assaulted -- what, may I ask, could be more needful? What could be more congruous with the codes of conscience and principled vision for Korea our laudable independence activists espoused?ã€€As esteemed independence leader Ahn Chang-ho expounded, 'moral self-training equals independenceï'and the 'only means of making our nation sound is to cultivate in ourselves a sound personality.ï'Dosan underscored the necessity for 'moral educationï'-- as cleverness devoid of goodness results in destruction. ã€€In 2014, international religious leaders proclaimed -- calling for the elimination of human trafficking by 2020 -- this endemic and pernicious vortex of inhumanity signifies 'modern-day slavery.'ã€€According to multiple reports, Koreans -- of both the North and South -- somehow remain among the most trafficked groups in the world. ã€€I agree, the 'pain from forced mobilization during the Japanese colonial rule still persists,ï'as was outlined in your aforementioned speech.ã€€It is unfortunate that many today flippantly dismiss rather than reflect upon this ugly reality: Certain collaborators with fascist Japan were involved in the trafficking of women, in addition to violently persecuting Korea's independence activists -- who loved Korea more than their lives, and frequently paid the ultimate price on behalf of the nation's liberty.ã€€Indeed, exemplary freedom-fighters, on the wings of 1919's March 1st Movement -- that sublime watershed, appropriately credited as the true genesis of the Korean nation -- resolved to eradicate prostitution and its concomitant human rights violations, as evidenced by 1919's Provisional Government Constitution.ã€€To remove all damaging spiritual and psychological vestiges of Japanese colonial rule from Korean society and effectually heal associated national traumas, we must squarely punish and expunge misogynist, predacious and imbecilic malevolence toward women. Such idiocy shamefully and plainly evokes the contaminated, debased and contemptible mindsets of that rightfully denounced era, and spiritually perpetuates colonialism's abhorred legacy together with its repugnant and nefarious ill-influence.Thank you for your reported intensified efforts to stamp out sex crimes in Korea. Please effectively punish all trafficking rings and dissemble the machinery (websites, cameras, poorly enforced laws, etc.) enabling them. Please comprehensively terminate the 'modern-dayï'enslavement of all Koreans.By Robert ParkRobert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience.

Only one school signed up but was unable to use the book due to a suit filed by parents of children there.The Moon administration has banned the use of state-authored history textbooks at middle and high schools.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (92%); HISTORY (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (89%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (78%); WRITERS (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); CHILDREN (77%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (77%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (77%); HIGH SCHOOLS (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (76%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (75%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (75%); DICTATORSHIPS (74%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (73%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (72%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (72%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (71%); DEMOCRACIES (70%); PRIME MINISTERS (70%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (69%); LITIGATION (69%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (66%); COMMUNITY ACTIVISM (53%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%); MOON JAE-IN (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: September 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The sole reason why I entered North Korea via Hoeryung city on Dec. 25, 2009 was to call attention to human rights violations that have occurred against innocents in the region and to demand better conditions -- conducive to life -- for North Koreans. On a personal level, I have been profoundly wounded and suffered loss on an incalculable and irretrievable scale as a result of these efforts to highlight the North Korean populace's severe victimization and unjust suffering. Accordingly, I sincerely beg that whatever you decide to do in concert with South Korean authorities and the international community that none of the ordinary people of both North and South Korea will ever get hurt; Koreans have already endured and sacrificed far too much.It's been brought to my attention that persons who have advised you and are within your administration profess to be Christians. Please kindly be reminded that a large number of underground Christians are within North Korea. They are the most persecuted religious group in the world, according to multiple watchdogs of religious rights internationally. As I pray your team accepts upon deep reflection, it would be decidedly un-Christian to countenance indiscriminate killings of those who are among the people in the world who suffer the most. As was recorded by a 2013 United Nations Commission of Inquiry, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 'Christians still professing their religion secretlyï'despite 'high risksï'are in North Korea today.Another ethical dilemma vis-a-vis military strikes would be that North Korea's political prison camps -- where thousands of Christians are imprisoned and suffering grievously -- are near weapons of mass destruction facilities and test sites. For instance, as was written in the above-cited UN report: 'Political Prison Camp No. 16 covers about 560 square kilometres of rugged terrain in Myonggan, North Hamgyong Province. It is located in close proximity to the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. ... The GeoCoordinates for the central area of Camp 16 are 41.1849N 129.2032E.'Furthermore, an estimated 10 million Korean families were heartbreakingly severed by the brutal realities engendered through Korea's division. Fewer than 1 percent have been permitted to see or even hear from their missing or displaced loved ones to date. As the artificial border became fixed, whether Koreans discovered themselves in the North or the South amid the tumult and upheaval of the period was in innumerable cases but a question of chance. The South's President Moon Jae-in -- like a multitude of South Koreans, Korean-Americans and other Koreans worldwide -- has family in North Korea. Therefore, it is my sincere and tearful prayer that you, Mr. President, would take into serious consideration these excruciatingly painful and unresolved tragedies, while honoring the moral imperative to determine a peaceful resolution vis-a-vis the security predicament.We must remember Kim Jong-un disallows North Koreans all of the basic freedoms most of us take for granted. North Koreans of all classes and backgrounds are not permitted to read what they wish. Neither are they able to travel freely within their own territory. Going abroad is simply out of the question for the overwhelming majority. Punishments in retaliation for being caught with books such as the Bible, or accidentally speaking out of turn or appearing irreverent, for example, are draconian and routinely deadly. These are but a few of the reasons the whole area is often referred to as a single enormous prison.High-level escapee Thae Yong-ho, who defected to the South last year with his immediate family, characterizes North Korea as a 'gigantic slave society that exists only for the hereditary succession of the Kim family.ï'Although once among Kim Jong-un's most entrusted -- having been Pyongyang's diplomat in London for 10 years -- he bravely declared subsequent to escaping, 'I am very determined to do everything possible to pull down the regime to save not only my family members but also the whole North Korean people from slavery.'There are countless individuals -- even among North Korea's elite and military -- who confidentially share Thae's hunger and thirst for reform and transformation within the North today. I know this with certainty. Here is my earnest, wholehearted and tearful plea to you, Mr. President: Please unconditionally preserve the lives of both North and South Korea's general population. Under no circumstances -- if international laws, norms and principles professing to safeguard innocentsï'most sacred right to life contain any substance -- can the loss of their lives be tolerated. There is a thoroughly workable and peaceable solution to the North Korea crisis. It involves reaching out to the general populace of North Korea in sympathy and supporting their internal unseating of Kim Jong-un -- one individual. This procedure must be accompanied by the freeing of all political prisoners -- who are victims of crimes against humanity and possibly genocide -- which can be achieved via the mediation of those North Koreans who assume interim administrative responsibilities in the immediate aftermath of Kim's indigenous and peaceful ouster.Elite or senior-level defections are conspicuously rising. The South's Ministry of Unification recently reported that this year, North Korean elites -- including party officials, diplomats, and university professors -- are defecting twice as often as in 2016. Numerous members of the North's military have been defecting to the South as of late, as well. Countless more have died while attempting to flee.In July, an elite-level family of five -- including a former North Korean party official, his wife, son and two daughters -- struggled courageously to defect to the South. They carried poison with them to kill themselves -- as an alternative to Kim Jong-un's systematic cruelty -- if Chinese authorities forcibly repatriated them. Heartbreakingly, these refugees deserving of protection were apprehended en route. To avoid inhumanity and torture, all five members of this senior-level family committed suicide. As Thae Yong-ho has emphasized, high-ranking North Koreans are in actual fact slaves and are suffering gravely also.The overwhelming majority of North Koreans hope and yearn to be reunified with the South, to live in a gentler and more egalitarian society and to bid adieu to Kim Jong-un. Those who suggest otherwise, Mr. President, unfortunately retain an inaccurate assessment of the overall situation on the ground.Accordingly, we must reach out to the North Korean people if a peaceable solution is veritably what we seek. The native and nonviolent ousting of Kim Jong-un is distinctly achievable. I've been praying through an outpouring of tears and wholeheartedly plead for you and your administration to remember the acute suffering and unparalleled victimization of tens of millions of warm-hearted, gentle and benevolent North Koreans -- who deserve compassion and require grace -- and to please pursue a peaceable answer with regard to the security quandary. Thank you once again for your time and attentiveness to the above concerns.

General Assembly's resolutions on Pyongyang's dire human rights record and that Kim Jong-un must be punished accordingly.Although it did not explicitly mention Kim, the General Assembly asked the U.N. Security Council to refer the North Korean leadership to the ICC for human rights abuses in its annual resolutions from 2014 to 2016.'We'll urge the ICC to consider prosecuting Kim Jong-un once again on the occasion of Kim Jong-nam's death,' said Kang Cheol-hwan, a defector-turned activist who leads the North Korean Strategy Center in Seoul, Wednesday.Referring to North Korean suspects in connection with Kim Jong-nam's murder, Kang said, 'Kim Jong-nam should be seen as a symbolic victim of Pyongyang's state-sponsored crimes against humanity.'Kang also said addressing the assassination and other acts of terrorism the North commits against its people overseas is critical, as well as raising awareness toward human rights abuses within the country.Other anti-Pyongyang groups, such as NK Watch and North Korea, said they recently visited the ICC in The Hague, the Netherlands and requested prosecution of Kim Jong-un.Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University, raised the possibility of the UNSC discussing the referral of Kim Jong-un to the ICC and also issues on North Korea's eligibility as a U.N. member.'If North Korea is confirmed to be responsible for Kim Jong-nam's death, then its human rights issues are likely to be highlighted more than its acts of terrorism because it killed its own citizen in a third country,' Chang said.Meanwhile, NK Watch Executive Director Ahn Myeong-cheol, a former guard at political prison camps in North Korea, said he will host a discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, March 13, to confess to torture and other inhumane acts he committed against prisoners.'Usually, there has been testimony from victims of North Korea's human rights abuses on the international stage while Pyongyang has been denying such crimes,' Ahn said. 'I, as a perpetrator, will testify about my own experience so that the repressive regime will be in a tougher situation to hide its crimes.'Some scholars said acquiring evidence to prove a link between Kim Jong-un and Pyongyang's violation of human rights will be key to bring the young tyrant before the ICC.'The most critical matter at an ICC trial, if it is held, is to prove that Kim Jong-un ordered the abuse of the human rights of his people,' said Kwon O-gon, a former permanent judge on the U.N.'s International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.He said collecting testimony from high-profile insiders, such as North Korea's former Deputy Ambassador to the United Kingdom Thae Yong-ho, will be important.During a KBS interview, Tuesday, Thae, who defected to South Korea last year, claimed that 'Everything is carried out under Kim Jong-un's orders,' regarding North Korea's rebuttal of Malaysia's interim findings on Kim Jong-nam's death.Thae said Kim Jong-nam's murder can be a crucial reference in taking Kim Jong-un to the ICC in the future.Kwon speculated that bringing Kim Jong-un before the ICC exclusively over the death of his half-brother would not be easy.'We instead should underscore that North Korea has been committing similar types of crimes systematically and widely, and that such acts are crimes against humanity as defined by the ICC,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); DEATH & DYING (89%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); PRISONERS (78%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (78%); TERRORIST ATTACKS (78%); CORRECTIONS (78%); TORTURE (76%); EXECUTIVES (73%); TERRORISM (71%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (65%); MURDER (58%)ORGANIZATION: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (93%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (91%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS (73%); GENEVA, SWITZERLAND (51%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); MALAYSIA (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); NETHERLANDS (90%); SWITZERLAND (51%)LOAD-DATE: February 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

"91","[David Ignatius] How fog of uncertainty can lead to war",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[David Ignatius] How fog of uncertainty can lead to war   THE KOREA HERALD September 6, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday[David Ignatius] How fog of uncertainty can lead to war LENGTH: 808 wordsWhen today??s historians look at the confrontation between the United States and North Korea, they??re likely to hear echoes of ultimatums, bluffs and botched messages that accompanied conflicts of the past, often with catastrophic consequences. ??The one thing that??s certain when you choose war as a policy is that you don??t know how it will end,?? says Mark Stoler, a diplomatic and military historian at the University of Vermont. This fog of uncertainty should be a caution for policymakers now in dealing with North Korea. History teaches that wars often result from bellicose rhetoric and bad information. Sometimes leaders fail to act strongly enough to deter aggression, as at Munich in 1938. But more often, as in August 1914, conflict results from a cascade of errors that produces an outcome that no one would have wanted. World War I is probably the clearest example of how miscalculation can produce a global disaster. As Stoler recounted to me in an interview, each player was caught in ??the cult of the offensive,?? believing that his nation??s aims could be fulfilled in a short war, at relatively low cost. It was a tragic sequence: After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Austria asked for Germany??s support against Serbia; Kaiser Wilhelm foolishly offered a ??blank check.?? Russia, Serbia??s ally, began mobilizing forces; Germany countered with its own mobilization, as did France, and then Britain. In the nuclear age, the costs of miscalculation are much greater, but good sense -- and luck -- have prevailed, so far. Evan Thomas explains in ??Ike??s Bluff?? that President Eisenhower appeared close to the brink in the Korean War in 1953. ??If the Chinese and North Koreans failed to come to terms, American diplomats were to broadly hint, the United States would expand the war with nuclear weapons,?? he writes. Whether Eisenhower would have dropped the bomb is anyone??s guess; amazingly, it??s not clear his ominous messages were even passed or understood. Eisenhower played chicken again in 1958, when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave him an ultimatum that the US must remove its troops from Berlin. Ike promised his aides that he was ??all in?? against this threat. But soon after, he invited the Soviet leader to visit America, and after an intimate weekend with the president??s grandchildren at his farm in Gettysburg, Khrushchev backed off. The Cuban missile crisis is the ultimate moment of nuclear brinkmanship. But this story is murkier than it??s sometimes described, says Philip Zelikow, co-author with Graham Allison of ??Essence of Decision,?? the classic study of the event. President Kennedy made an ultimatum to Khrushchev on Oct. 27, 1962, that averted war. But that was only after Khrushchev ignored an earlier Sept. 13 warning against putting nuclear weapons in Cuba. Would Kennedy really have gone to war if Khrushchev hadn??t backed down? He told a navy commander later that he would have started combat operations on Oct. 30. Modern history shows how wars are interwoven with promises and ultimatums, some honored and others ignored, Zelikow explains. Germany offered the 1916 ??Sussex Pledge?? that its submarines wouldn??t attack American ships and then did so anyway, drawing the US into war. China warned in 1965 that an American invasion of North Vietnam would bring Chinese intervention, and US troops stayed below the DMZ. America advised Iraq in 1991 that unless its troops left Kuwait, the US would attack. The Iraqis didn??t and America did. And in a folly whose consequences persist to this day, America invaded Iraq in 2003 because of false intelligence that it had weapons of mass destruction. How should we apply history to the current standoff with North Korea? First, messaging is critically important. With so much at stake, it??s crazy for President Trump to be sending sensitive signals about war and peace in 140-character public tweets. Second, evidence suggests that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a genuinely dangerous risk-taker. US officials calculate that he has conducted more than 80 missile or bomb tests since becoming ruler in 2011, compared with just 20 under his father. Would the impulsive Kim ever be ready for negotiations with Trump? So far, he has spurned peace overtures from the US, answering American calls for restraint with three more tests. North Korea claims he??s acting defensively, provoked by joint U.S. military exercises with South Korea last month. Is Kim??s position a charade? Let??s find out. No new US-South Korean exercises are scheduled until next March. That offers a six-month window to push Pyongyang to explore options. As history shows, the consequences of making a mistake in war are calamitous.By David Ignatius David Ignatius?? email address is davidignatius@washpost.com.--Ed (Washington Post Writers Group)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HISTORY (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); MILITARY WEAPONS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); WAR & CONFLICT (89%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (89%); KOREAN WAR (78%); WORLD WAR I (77%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (77%); MILITARY OPERATIONS (76%); ARMED FORCES (76%); WRITERS (67%); INTERVIEWS (67%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT (57%)PERSON: JOHN F KENNEDY (79%)CITY: BERLIN, GERMANY (79%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (95%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); SERBIA (92%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (79%); GERMANY (79%); CUBA (66%); AUSTRIA (55%); FRANCE (54%)LOAD-DATE: September 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

According to the National Institute for International Education on Thursday, the accumulated number of takers of the Test of Proficiency in Korean, or TOPIK, stood at 2.12 million after the most recent test in November. The number of countries where the test is taken was 73, up from just four in 1997. TOPIK scores are a requirement for foreigners to obtain some types of visa or college places in South Korea. Nearly 300,000 took the test this year alone, a 140-fold jump from 1997 when 2,692 people sat for the exam, according to the data. The popularity of South Korean television dramas and pop music are one contributor to the upsurge, the institute said. The test, which started off as a once-a-year event, has been held six times a year since 2015 to reflect the growing demand. The number of elementary and secondary schools abroad that offer Korean language courses also rose from 695 in 2011 to 1,309 as of 2016, according to Ministry of Education's data.

Sim Sang-jeung, chairwoman of the minor opposition Justice Party and local civic group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy questioned accounting methods that led to a sudden rise in Samsung BioLogics' net profit in 2015.ã€€Samsung BioLogics, which has remained unprofitable since its foundation in 2011, suddenly reported a net profit of 1.9 trillion won ($1.66 billion) in 2015. The new influx of profit had been generated by a new method of valuing its stake in its subsidiary Samsung Bioepis.(Samsung BioLogics)ã€€BioLogics explained its stake ownership was calculated into its net profit as a one-time event after Bioepis' status changed from a subsidiary to an affiliate under the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by Korea.ã€€A company is considered a subsidiary if the parent company possesses a majority stake in the firm, and an affiliate or associate if it holds a minority stake.ã€€Samsung Bioepis is a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics (91.2 percent) and US-based Biogen (8.8 percent). Under their joint venture agreement, Biogen can exercise a call option effective until the end of 2018 to expand its stake in Bioepis to up to 49.9 percent.ã€€Bioepis took on affiliate status after it underwent an audit to determine its market value and the costs that BioLogics would have to shoulder in case Biogen exercised its call option.The audit awarded Bioepis a valuation of 5.27 trillion won, based on an improved outlook for the firm's future profitability following the sales approval of its biosimilar drugs in Europe and Korea.The audit also concluded that the call option would cause a debt of 1.82 trillion won for BioLogics, which was reflected into the value of its stake in Bioepis which fell to 2.98 trillion won, BioLogics said.ã€€According to BioLogics, the rise in Bioepis' market value raised the weight and likelihood of Biogen's call option, which when exercised would weaken BioLogics' ownership over Bioepis. It was thereby under such circumstances that Bioepis took on affiliate status.ã€€Samsung BioLogics' net profit reported in 2015, hence, was calculated based on the change in its relationship to Samsung Bioepis, the company said. From 2016, Bioepis' performance is no longer included in BioLogics' accounting records.ã€€Rep. Sim and the PSPD took issue with this particular accounting method, saying it differs from that of Biogen which has not calculated its call option -- which it has yet to exercise -- when considering its stake in Bioepis.ã€€Samsung BioLogics credited this difference to varying accounting principles adopted by each company. While Biogen follows the US GAAP accounting standard adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BioLogics follows IFRS regulations.ã€€The Justice Party chairwoman and the PSPD also suggested problems with the calculation used to arrive at a multitrillion won evaluation for Bioepis, questioning its profitability outlook over the next five years.ã€€The market values of unlisted companies such as Samsung Bioepis are set by accounting firms based on projections of their future profitability. According to the IFRS regulations, this projection would be based on a maximum five year time frame, unless there are ""proper reasons"" dictating otherwise.ã€€The accounting firms had reportedly based its valuation of Bioepis based on a longer projection time frame of around 20 years, in consideration of the slow pace of new drug development and the pharmaceutical industry.ã€€""(Deloitte) Anjin determined Samsung Bioepis' valuation of 5.27 trillion won based on Samsung Bioepis' projections for the revenue and cash flow of its biosimilar drugs, their probability for success and the related risks,"" Samsung BioLogics said.ã€€Samsung BioLogics further argued that its ""one-time"" net profit generated by its stake in Bioepis ""did not impact the valuation of Samsung BioLogics (ahead of its Kospi listing) in any way.""ã€€""Samsung BioLogics had already met the listing standards of the US-based Nasdaq as well as Korea's Kosdaq even when it was in the red,"" the company said, adding that BioLogics' value was determined by its own production capacity and Bioepis' biosimilar development status in comparison to market competitors.ã€€Furthermore, Samsung BioLogics strongly denied recurring allegations that it received preferential treatment when seeking a public listing on the Kospi last year.ã€€In November 2015, Korea's Financial Service Commission revised its listing regulations to allow companies in the red to be listed on the country's main bourse. The revision allowed Samsung BioLogics, which had yet to generate any profit, to make a stock debut a year later.ã€€Samsung BioLogics stated it ""did not receive any form of preferential treatment during the process of its Kospi listing or after its public listing.""ã€€It reiterated its former stance that it had initially pushed for a public listing on the US-based Nasdaq, where many global biopharma companies are listed, but decided on a Kospi listing after repeated requests from the Korea Exchange to be listed on a local bourse.ã€€By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ACCOUNTING (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); COMPANY PROFITS (90%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (90%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (90%); COMPANY EARNINGS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); AUDITS (89%); AGREEMENTS (78%); ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (77%); PARENT COMPANIES (77%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (72%); APPROVALS (70%); JOINT VENTURES (64%); DEMOCRACIES (55%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (85%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (85%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (85%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (85%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (85%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); EUROPE (52%)LOAD-DATE: February 16, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Yen climbed the mountain to look for her lost husband and it was so sad that she could not stop crying for almost two hours, she said.'I guess I was very much involved in the character that I played and crew at the spot were worried that I may be unable to cry in the last scene because I cried so much in the scene shot at the mountain,' Do said during a Korea Times interview at Lotte Cinema in Jamsil World Tower, eastern Seoul, Thursday.'In Vietnam, there is a tradition in which you have to take care of the family and Yen is a person who does not know how to write or read and she barely speaks of her heart. She would not talk of her issues when she is hurt and she would bury them into her heart.'The actress said her personality is very different from Yen and so she would never understand her husband if he cheated on her.Because Yen is such a quiet character, Do said it was difficult to portray Yen's emotions with the eyes.'We shot many scenes at night and I had to only act with the eyes because Yen talked so little. Also, I had to play Yen when she was 13, 20 and 38 years old and I had to do a lot of research before acting the different Yen at different ages. It was very difficult.'The Vietnamese actress arrived in Seoul with director Tuan Vu Dinh a day before her official itinerary with Vietnam Film Day in Korea began last Wednesday. She lauded Korean staff for their professionalism and said it was honor for her to showcase the Vietnamese film.'I hope Korean people remember me by Yen after watching this film,' Do said.Director Dinh shared how he came up with the idea for the movie.He said he was only 27 when he met a student from a film school whose script about her grandmother impressed him so deeply that he decided to make it into a movie.'She was only 26 years old and my colleague at my work gave me the script,' Dinh said. 'I was very surprised and touched by the story written by only a film school student.'The film tells the story of Yen who gets married at 13 and confronts various family issues but decides to embrace them for the sake of her family's happiness.'In the scene, Yen's husband travels to the faraway capital city to earn a living for the family but Yen finds out he cheats on her,' Dinh said. 'However, Yen decided to hide the fact from the children because she wants the family to be happy and the children to respect their father. The movie contains themes of Vietnamese love for family and a Vietnamese woman's sacrifice for family.'The director said he has watched many Korean movies and is fan of Kim Ki-duk and Park Chan-wook's films such as 'Pieta' (2012) and 'Old Boy' (2003).Dinh said Korean movies focus on delivering messages to society and have strong appeal with their ideas. Vietnamese films depict stories of family values and their characters' psychology because the movies' scale is comparatively smaller than that of other countries.The young director picked Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yi Mou as his role model. Zhang produces well-known films dealing with people's psychology and family values.Dinh said he is happy to introduce his film to Korea as part of Vietnam Film Day in Korea, which celebrates the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ACTORS & ACTRESSES (90%); FILM (89%); FILM SCHOOLS (89%); FAMILY (89%); INTERVIEWS (79%); JAPANESE YEN (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (64%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (71%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (90%); VIET NAM (90%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (71%)LOAD-DATE: January 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"96","[Robert Park] A path to free NK political prisoners",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Robert Park] A path to free NK political prisoners    THE KOREA HERALD June 22, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 22, 2017 Thursday[Robert Park] A path to free NK political prisoners  LENGTH: 1029 wordsCircumstances are ripe for South Korea, the United States, and the international community to adopt a fresh approach to address the North Korean crisis. High-ranking officials in North Korea are disaffected to an unprecedented degree, and granting amnesty to them may ultimately lead to the removal of Kim Jong-un.?In an April 6 analysis, Bruce Bennett, a senior researcher at the RAND Corporation, listed ways President Donald Trump could attempt to deal with North Korea, which included conventional strategies such as intensifying sanctions, increasing pressure on China to enforce sanctions, and even preventive military strikes. However, he concluded saying that the safest option would be to negotiate ??a peaceful end to the 60-year-standoff on the peninsula?? by providing the North Korean elite with an alternative to their ??murderous and unstable leader.?? He added that such an approach ??could be the safest and most realistic way to sheath North Korean nuclear weapons and safeguard the American people.???Co-opting North Korea??s elite to depose Kim is not just the only feasible path toward neutralizing the nuclear threat -- barring a reckless and likely catastrophic ??preventive war?? -- but also may be the only opening to dismantle the North??s prison camp system and preserve the lives of its victims. None have ever escaped the North??s ??absolute-control-zones,?? which offer no possibility for release. Any strategy to precipitate political change must take into account both the impact any action may have on these prisoners and the urgent need to address their condition.?Another RAND Corporation study from April 27, ??Preparing North Korean Elites for Unification,?? asks the vital question of what would happen if such a strategy were not followed, and soon. Continued escalation in the North, and the reported US ??red line?? of proof of nuclear ICBM capability, suggests a horrendous war could be on the horizon. Decisive action may be needed to pre-empt this threat. ?The report, which was sponsored by the Seoul-based Korea Foundation, states, ??North Korean propaganda indoctrinates its elites to believe that unification, especially unification led by the ROK, would be a disaster for them. At unification, according to one North Korean propaganda statement, the United States and the ROK will ??exterminate the core class families first.?? ... Many worry that South Korea will treat them brutally, throwing them in prison, executing them.???South Korea and the international community should begin surreptitiously reaching out to North Korea??s elite to counter such incendiary propaganda. The RAND report suggests that Kim??s ??purges and brutality have made many of his senior personnel very scared of him, while at the same time his leadership is also largely seen as failing.?? These officials may therefore be responsive to overtures from Seoul.?As former Pyongyang ambassador Thae Yong-ho has highlighted, there is no credible ??second-in-command?? within Kim Jong-un??s totalitarian framework, rendering the peaceful reunification of Korea feasible ??if something happens?? to Kim. Thae also emphasized the threat that wide-scale elite defection could pose to the regime, but explained that fear was keeping discontented officials from organizing a coup.?Thus, as Thae stressed recently, it is important for South Korea and the global community to attempt to convince these elites that they would not be punished by Seoul in the event of reunification but under the condition that they verifiably protect and release all political prisoners.?Thae??s risky defection precipitated in part by a reported purge of nearly 1,000 people and his ensuing celebrity status in the South demonstrate the viability of such an initiative. South Koreans have embraced Thae, despite being previously counted among the ranks of the North Korean regime??s star propagandists. Ex prison-camp guards have also been rehabilitated and integrated into South Korean society, even leading to reconciliation with former prisoners.?While taking any step toward amnesty, we must carefully consider the impact these actions could have on the people imprisoned by the North Korean regime. At a UN hearing, an ex-guard cautioned that Kim would massacre all political captives at the first sign of war in order to cover up evidence of his atrocities, testifying: ??In case a war breaks out ... we are supposed to wipe out the prisoners. ... Every camp has artillery to annihilate all evidence, should there be an attack or a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.???Offers of amnesty to the North Korean elite must be contingent upon the release of all political prisoners and termination of egregious human rights violations. It??s vital to remember there are up to hundreds of thousands of innocents, approximately one-third of them children, who are victims of crimes against humanity in Kim??s network of concentration camps.?The policy of conditional amnesty should be conveyed via 24-hour radio broadcasts into North Korea, as well as leaflets and other media disseminated across the whole country.

Conditional amnesty accompanied by reunification may be the only way to protect the lives of political prisoners and dismantle the prison camp system.

The phonograph, a device that uses cylinders to record and reproduce sounds, is the earliest commercial recording medium invented by Thomas Edison. The first known recording of 'Arirang' was made in Washington in 1896 by US anthropologist Alice C. Fletcher, who recorded the 'Arirang' song by three Korean students studying in the US. Ahn Jeong-sik, Lee Hee-cheol and Son. Rong sang a total of 11 songs in the recordings, with three of them being 'Arirang.ï'The cylinders were introduced in Korea over a century later in 1998. It is currently owned by the US Library of Congress.Another 'Arirangï'recording was made in a prisoners of war camp in Germany between 1916 and 1917.Grigori Kim, Stepan An and Gawriel Kang -- ethnic Koreans drafted by the Soviet military and taken prisoners during World War I -- sang several Korean folk songs including 'Arirang,ï'and the recordings are currently owned by the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.In addition to the original recordings, the earliest sheet music of the song will also be on display at the festival. US missionary and educator Homer B. Hulbert was reportedly an 'Arirangï'enthusiast and he contributed a paper, 'Korean Vocal Music,ï'to a Seoul-based magazine, 'Korean Repository,ï'in 1896. Sheet music of 'Arirangï'-- later known as 'Hulbert Arirangï'-- was included in the paper.Hulbert also sent sheet music detailing the children's version of 'Arirangï'in a letter to his sister in 1886. The song was later known simply as 'Kidsï'Arirang.'Recorded versions of 'Hulbert Arirangï'and 'Kidsï'Arirangï'will be on display at the exhibition.The exhibition will also display the earliest recording devices, including Edison-standard phonographs and the cylinder record shaving machine, which 'shavedï'the surface of records for re-recording.In addition to the exhibition, Seoul Arirang Festival will feature 'Arirangï'performances and contests.The Gwanghwamun Music Festival on Oct. 14 will feature Korean music acts including singer and rapper Heize, Korean traditional music band Jambinai, along with rock bands No Brain and Monni.Street performances by up-and-coming musicians and contests involving musicians and performers from across the country will also be held.Visit the event's official homepage (seoularirangfestival.com) for its schedule and more information in Korean, English, German, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese and French.The annual festival was first held in 2013 to commemorate the inscription of 'Arirangï'on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity program by UNESCO in 2012.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FOLK & WORLD MUSIC (90%); MUSIC (89%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (89%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (89%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (89%); FESTIVALS (89%); MUSIC INDUSTRY (89%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (78%); POP & ROCK (78%); NATIONAL LIBRARIES (76%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (74%); HIP HOP CULTURE (73%); RAP MUSIC (73%); WORLD WAR I (71%); POWS & MIAS (71%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (71%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (69%); STREET ART (68%); SPECIAL LIBRARIES (66%)ORGANIZATION: PRISONERS OF WAR (55%); LIBRARY OF CONGRESS (55%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); BERLIN, GERMANY (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (91%); GERMANY (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (55%)LOAD-DATE: September 27, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

"99","Ecuadorian artist distills mystic beauty of homeland",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","Ecuadorian artist distills mystic beauty of homeland   THE KOREA HERALD August 15, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 15, 2017 TuesdayEcuadorian artist distills mystic beauty of homeland LENGTH: 991 wordsBorn on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuadorian artist Miguel Betancourt grew up seeing clear blue sky, colorful vegetation and trees and the spirited people of the Andean mountains. Over the next several decades, the powerful images imbued in his early consciousness would set him on a mission to distill the mystic beauty of Ecuador, a melting pot of antiquity and ecology at the northwestern edge of South America. From the untamed tropical jungle to timeworn colonial architecture, Betancourt has tapped his creative imagination to reinterpret his homeland??s vibrant colors, figures and rhythm.The internationally acclaimed artist is famous for his fusion of Ecuadorian and European motifs and patterns. Born in 1958, he has lived an energetic, peripatetic life across the world, showcasing his works in the United States, Europe, Australia and China, among others. Marking the 208th anniversary of Ecuador??s National Day, the First Call for Independence, some 50 of his paintings are on display at the Superior Gallery in Seoul through Aug. 31, organized by the Ecuadorian Embassy. ??I like to draw things related to my motherland, its environment, landscapes and architecture,?? Betancourt told The Korea Herald at the opening ceremony of the exhibition ??Ecuador Through My Dreams?? on Thursday. ??I am very eager to show to the world the ideas that have shaped us through the convergence of civilizations. Ecuador is an amalgam of diverse ethnicities, cultures and natural habits.??Most Ecuadorians, including Betancourt, have mixed blood of indigenous and European origins, and are called ??mestizos,?? he pointed out.Betancourt mostly works with acrylic, oil and watercolors on different textiles and papers these days. His paintings are vivaciously colorful and vigorous, with rough-hewn brushstrokes of indigo, yellow and red crisscrossing across the canvas. He has also used wood, tree branches, volcanic ashes and other earthly materials in his creations.The colors come from primitive textiles spun by Ecuador??s ancient cultures, he said, mentioning pre-Columbian civilizations the Valdivia, Quitus, Caras and Canaris, which existed for millennia before the Incan Empire.??We have very old and interesting indigenous cultures that existed thousands of years ago, with highly refined and exquisite art,?? he explained. ??They thrived along the Pacific coast, in the Amazon jungle and the Andean mountains and near present-day capital Quito. I am intensely interested in showing our distant past before the Spanish colonization.??Noting that the outside world is largely unaware of Ecuador??s long forgotten past, he highlighted his efforts to express these native subjects and symbols in new ways, before promoting them on the world stage. Betancourt studied at the Milwaukee Art Center in the US, Pontificia Universersidad Catolica del Ecuador, and Slade School of Fine Art at the University College London on a British Council scholarship. He was chosen to represent Ecuador at the 45th International Art Expo at the Venice Biennale in 1993, and received the Pollock-Krasner Award by the eponymous foundation in New York City in the same year. The University of Western Sydney invited Betancourt to lecture on Ecuadorian art and exhibit his works at the Canberra Museum and Gallery in 2000. Two of his works are also part of the United Nations?? art collections in Vienna and Geneva. Several of his paintings have been inspired by the ??Virgin of Quito?? -- a wooden sculpture by artist Bernardo de Legarda (ca. 1700-73) venerated at the altar of the Church and Convent of San Francisco in Quito -- a figure of popular veneration throughout the northern Andes region. ??I am not religious but respectful of our religions,?? the painter highlighted, noting he takes key essences of national emblems and impregnates them with avant-garde identities. ??Architecture and sculpture are other big sources of my inspiration. Ecuador has a wealth of Incan temples and Baroque-style colonial buildings, notable for their trapezoidal form and ornamental facades.??In the words of art critic Marta Traba, Ecuador participates in today??s world art scene through aesthetic pluralism and the fusion of techniques and methods, all part of the globalization of art. Betancourt belongs to this ??eclectic generation?? of Ecuadorian artists, and responds to these global artistic movements by delineating his own contours, she wrote in a journal, ??Expressions of Experience: An insight into the vivid range of contemporary art in Ecuador.??As in other parts of the world, being a financially successful artist is no easy, according to Betancourt. ??Artists cannot sit with their arms crossed and wait for people to come and see their works. We consciously have to promote ourselves,?? he argued. ??There are limits to what the government can do to promote art and culture. Just like businesses seeking opportunities around the world, I think artists should embrace globalization. Otherwise we become isolated.??Regardless, artists?? chief reason being is to give a testimony of ??who we are,?? he asserted. ??I believe that an artist must begin at his roots to arrive at the universal. My Ecuadorian essence is founded in the confrontation of different cultures. I try to lift up my art by assimilating these aspects and expressing my native experiences.??Betancourt elucidated on Ecuador??s domestic situation, saying the country is in the midst of opening itself economically and diversifying its revenues from the petroleum-oriented development strategy. ??Ecuador is trying hard to promote its tourism. We offer diverse natural attractions, ranging from the Amazon forests and the Andes Mountains to spectacular coasts along the Pacific as well as the enchanting Galapagos Islands,?? he said. ??I believe opportunities for international cooperation will grow in the future in diverse areas, starting with tourism.??By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); PAINTING (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (78%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (78%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (78%); CELEBRITIES (78%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (76%); ARCHITECTURE (76%); TRADE SHOWS (74%); EXHIBITIONS (74%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (73%); ECOLOGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (72%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (70%); RACE & ETHNICITY (70%); TEXTILES (69%); ANNIVERSARIES (68%); SCHOLARSHIPS & GRANTS (62%)CITY: QUITO, ECUADOR (92%); NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); LONDON, ENGLAND (50%)STATE: ANDES (93%); NEW YORK, USA (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (79%)COUNTRY: ECUADOR (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); SOUTH AMERICA (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); CHINA (79%); AUSTRALIA (79%); EUROPE (79%)LOAD-DATE: August 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Cho is the eldest daughter of Chairman Cho Yang-ho of Korean Air, the country's largest full-service carrier. In the first 13-member full-panel ruling deliberated by the 13 Supreme Court justices including chief justice Kim Meong-su after he took the top post, the court said she did not violate aviation law by ordering the plane to change its air route, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison.'The air route, the point of contention here, should be interpreted as referring to the aircraft's course when it is flying, not when it is taxiing on the ground,' the court said.'The lower court's ruling was apt in making such a determination, and there was no misinterpretation of the law that requires a review.'Cho was indicted in January 2015 for ordering a plane bound for Incheon to return to the gate from a taxiing area at JFK on Dec. 5, 2014. Mistakenly, the prosecution said Cho forced a flight that departed from JFK International Airport in New York bound for Incheon to change course. She ordered the plane to return to remove the chief flight attendant because she considered it a failure of first-class cabin service for a junior attendant to serve macadamia nuts in a bag and not on a plate, as she considered it a hassle for passengers to open the plastic bag. Cho also faced charges of committing acts of violence that disturbed flight safety, coercion, interfering with a business and interfering with the official duties of the flight crew by abusing her authority, all of which carry far less harsh sentences.Cho had pleaded not guilty to the main charge, arguing the airport runway should not be considered part of the 'air route.' She claimed she had ordered the chief flight attendant off the plane because he failed to memorize the service manual.A lower court sentenced her to one year in prison for obstructing aviation safety by ordering a taxiing plane to return to the gate over in-flight service. The conviction followed the court's ruling that it was questionable whether Cho really felt remorse about her actions, which the court deemed trampled on the integrity of humanity.However, she was released in May 2015 after an appellate court sentenced her to a 10-month prison term suspended for two years. The Seoul High Court acquitted her, saying the prosecution sought to interpret the definition of air route too restrictively to punish Cho.The so-called nut-rage case drew fierce public uproar over long-held practices exhibited by Korea's family-owned businesses, or chaebol, referred to as 'gapjil,' in which the rich and powerful do not care about the repercussions of their actions because they think they can get away with anything simply by paying people off or firing them.Children of chaebol families usually assume mid- to executive-level positions in their parents' companies at a young age regardless of their qualifications, simply because they can.This deeply embedded sense of entitlement _ a feeling of limitless power without any responsibilities _ has long ailed Korea, where young people without any such status ended up coining the term 'Hell Joseon,' a sarcastic expression comparing the name of the old Korean kingdom, Joseon, with hell.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DECISIONS & RULINGS (92%); ACQUITTAL (90%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); AIRLINES (90%); JAIL SENTENCING (89%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); SENTENCING (89%); AIRPORTS (89%); CORRECTIONS (89%); AIR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (89%); AIRLINE EMPLOYEES (86%); INDICTMENTS (78%); EXECUTIVES (78%); APPELLATE DECISIONS (78%); SUPREME COURTS (78%); JUDGES (78%); APPEALS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); CIVIL AVIATION (76%); TRANSPORTATION LAW (76%); AIRPORT RUNWAYS (74%); AVIATION TRANSPORTATION LAW (74%); APPEALS COURTS (73%)CITY: INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (54%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (91%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%); UNITED STATES (54%)LOAD-DATE: December 21, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Korea, as a divided country -- with millions of its people murdered at the hands of the genocidal Kim dynasty in the North, a regime never democratically elected -- has yet to substantively recover.?Rusk??s retrospective comments lay bare the unambiguous component of racism within such unscrupulous and callous maneuverings.?In the footage, captured while he was comfortably retired and enjoying his ??golden years,?? the controversial figure discusses the legacy of his friend Dean Acheson, who was secretary of state under the Truman administration and during the 1950-53 war. Rusk??s ghastly choice of words -- divulging his and Acheson??s juvenile and categorically inexcusable aversion toward international non-white ethnic minorities -- is one of the most shocking and damning indictments of post-World War II allied politics in Korea that I??m aware of. Even if Rusk -- in an unguarded moment -- simply was conveying what he and Dean Acheson had harbored within their hearts, this is still the case.?Rusk implicated that both he and Acheson were unapologetic ??omni-racists.?? In the footage, accessible on YouTube, he stated, ??Well, Dean Acheson was a brilliant man. His interests, really, were concentrated in the North Atlantic in terms of his own strong sense of personal commitment. After all, he had played a large role in the building of the Marshall Plan and the construction of NATO. And, from a geopolitical point of view one can understand why this North Atlantic relationship was looked upon as fundamental. He had less interest in the ... little yellow, brown, black people in various parts of the Earth.???Search ??Dean Rusk Korea?? and notice how his eyes animate with unaccountable hatred at the impromptu pause preceding those profoundly disgusting words. It??s vile and revolting -- further his divulgence contains consequential, far-reaching ramifications which must be assiduously evaluated and comprehended.?A 2003 article in the Los Angeles Times reveals then-US President Harry Truman was no better. The commentary noted that, although most people may not realize it, ??Truman??s bigotry comes as little surprise to historians who have studied the man and his career.???Truman made ??ugly comments?? about a diversity of non-white ethnic minorities as well -- and clung to such despicable and immoral prejudices throughout all phases of his life. The Associated Press reported in 1991 that he ??expressed strong racist sentiments before, during and after his presidency?? and cited a letter where Truman arrogantly and unashamedly boasted of ??race prejudice.???Trump has been reprehensibly singing the praises of an American president deemed even worse.?Andrew Jackson is reported to be Trump??s ??favorite president.?? But Jackson, the seventh US head of state, has been called the ??American Hitler?? for masterminding unmitigated evil such as the opprobrious Indian Removal Act and the Trail of Tears campaign of forced relocation, which killed thousands of innocent people. ?A March 2014 article in Slate magazine called Andrew Jackson -- who owned and sold slaves -- a ??mass murderer?? who ??engineered a genocide?? and was responsible for ??ethnic cleansing.???Trump has reportedly hung a portrait of one of history??s worst men in the Oval Office, saying in March he was a ??big fan?? of the white supremacist. ??Andrew Jackson had a great history?? he pronounced at an April Town Hall event.?He tweeted on March 16: ??Andrew Jackson: We thank you for your service. We honor your memory. We build on your legacy & we thank God for the USA!?? to the legitimate moral outrage of innumerable individuals and communities.?In a 1994 exhaustive study, historian David Stannard asserted that the genocide of Native Americans -- weighed in its entirety -- marks the ??worst human holocaust the world had ever witnessed ... consuming the lives of countless tens of millions of people.?? Trump??s remarks are unnervingly insensitive and may instigate intractable tensions.?Trump blurted ominously to the Washington Examiner on Sunday, ??North Korea weighs on me, but we have to be prepared for the worst. We have to be prepared to do what we have to do. We cannot allow this to go on.???In an April 28 interview with the National Interest, Daniel L. Davis, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank Defense Priorities, indicated that the chances of war on the Korean Peninsula at the current time are ??very high.?? When asked to give a percentage, he cautioned as high as 75 percent.?A commentary by Davis entitled ??Before Fighting a Costly War With North Korea, a Strategic Reassessment?? published the same day, underscores that there is no coherent logic in America attacking North Korea militarily to ??pre-empt?? Kim Jong-un from acquiring a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile.???But even if Pyongyang were to successfully build such a device -- no sure bet -- what logic would there be for him to use it??? Davis writes.??The United States is reported to have 6,800 nuclear weapons and could, therefore, vaporize their country several times over, while North Korea would likely not get more than one shot. What possible reason would Kim Jong-un have to take actions that would not accomplish his objectives but guaranteed to result in his destruction????In a Sunday interview, a Fox News anchor put before Trump??s national security adviser,???They have thousands of short range missiles that are aimed at Seoul, a metropolis of 25 million people. ... If we were to launch a pre-emptive strike against their nuclear program, their missile program, we??re talking about human catastrophe, aren??t we????In his response, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster -- who, in the same interview, indicated Trump??s demand for South Korea to pay $1 billion for an anti-missile system was subject to ??renegotiation?? -- acknowledged military action would signify this.?What would be the impetus which enables Trump to feign that military action, by way of preventive strikes, is justified???So, it is their -- the sixth nuclear test is what it would be, combined with the ballistic missile program that poses a grave threat to the United States and our citizens, as well as our friends and partners in the region.???Fox??s Chris Wallace asks later on, ??But, precisely to that point, can you envision a situation where North Korea becomes such a threat that we??re willing to take that risk of a fuselage of short range missiles hitting Seoul, a metropolis of millions of people????His alarming answer in full, before they moved onto other topics, ??What the president has first and foremost on his mind is to protect the American people.

We will not tolerate or stand idly by such a provocation against the sovereignty of Korea,' it added.The questions include whether Xi would agree with characterization of China having been part of Korea, referenced by Chinese history books written prior to the Song Dynasty (960-1279).In those books, according to the group, Beijing was part of Gojoseon and Goguryeo, the ancient kingdoms of Korea.The questions in detail will be released in Chinese and in English, Saturday and next week, respectively.The protest was in response to a remark by Trump during an interview with the Wall Street Journal on April 12, held a week after the summit between the U.S. and China. After the controversy erupted, the Wall Street Journal posted the full script of the interview.Trump said, according to the excerpts, 'He (Xi) then went into the history of China and Korea. Not North Korea, Korea. And you know, you're talking about thousands of years ""and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China.'Despite the possibility of mistranslation considering that they both used interpreters, his remark was seen as ignorant by many Koreans, triggering outrage at the carelessness of the U.S. leader.The group said rather than criticizing Trump, public outrage should be directed at the Chinese leader for making the remarks at all.'Trump probably repeated what he heard through the interpreters,' said Shim Baek-kang, the president of the Research Institute of Korean Studies.'He wouldn't have otherwise thought of such an idea. Therefore, we should ask how Xi was able to tell such a story with a politically charged agenda,' he added.According to historians, he added, the country name 'Korea' is derived from 'Goguryeo,' the original kingdom that is believed to have formed as a political entity as early as the 1st century B.C.Goguryeo once encompassed what is now Manchuria and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HISTORY (90%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (89%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); INTERVIEWS (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); POLITICS (78%); ANCIENT HISTORY (78%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (68%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (56%)COMPANY: WALL STREET JOURNAL (53%)PERSON: XI JINPING (92%); DONALD TRUMP (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); BEIJING, CHINA (58%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: CHINA (97%); NORTHERN ASIA (95%); UNITED STATES (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: April 26, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

However, AI is likely to make cheap labor irrelevant,' he said.As algorithms and robots replace truck drivers, factory workers and even doctors, cheap labor could lose its value, he said.'That might make future integration even harder. South Korea might face a crisis taking care of its own unemployed masses; it will not want to take care of millions of Northerners too.'He comes up with one positive influence for a faster integration of the two Koreas.'The profound changes caused by the rise of AI might destabilize the North Korean regime and lead to its collapse, while the South Korean hi-tech industry may generate so much prosperity in the South that it will actually find it easier to integrate the North,' he said.In the 21st century the rise of AI and biotechnology will certainly transform the world, but it does not mandate a single deterministic outcome, he said.'We can use it to create very different kinds of societies. How to use it wisely is the most important question facing humankind today,' he said. 'It is far more important than the global economic crisis, the wars in the Middle East, or the refugee crisis in Europe. The future not only of humanity, but probably of life itself, depends on how we choose to use AI and biotechnology.'Risks of rising nationalismHarari expressed concerns about growing nationalism worldwide which has been spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump is part of a larger nationalist wave that is sweeping over much of the world, he said. 'This is a very dangerous development. In the past, nationalism was dangerous because it bred war. In the 21st century, nationalism is even more dangerous, because in addition to fostering wars it is likely to prevent humankind from solving the existential problems we face.'He said all major problems facing the word are global in nature ? global warming, global inequality, and the rise of disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering.'In order to face these challenges successfully, we need global cooperation,' he said.He took an example that no nation can regulate bioengineering single-handedly as it won't help much if the U.S. forbids genetically engineering human babies if China or North Korea allows it.'Similarly, no nation can stop global warming by itself. Can Donald Trump build a wall against rising oceans? Because nationalism has no answer to global warming, it tends to simply deny the problem. But the problem is real,' he noted.'Hence I think the current wave of nationalism is a kind of escapism: people refusing to confront the unprecedented problems of the 21st century by closing their eyes and minds and by seeking a refuge in the fold of traditional local identities. I hope that people will wake up in time. For that, we probably need a new global ideology that can unite humankind.'If we want to survive and thrive, the world has little choice but to complement patriotism with substantial obligations toward a global community, the historian said.'If people nevertheless insist that the interests of their nation override all other loyalties and considerations, I would be curious to know how they plan to solve global warming and how they plan to handle the risks of nuclear war, artificial intelligence and biotechnology,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); HISTORY (90%); LABOR FORCE (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); WRITERS (78%); PSYCHOLOGY (77%); INTERVIEWS (76%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (75%); BESTSELLERS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (70%); FACTORY WORKERS (70%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (67%); MIGRATION ISSUES (63%); EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS (63%); REFUGEES (50%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (78%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); ISRAEL (90%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (78%)LOAD-DATE: February 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Students, civic groups, workers and even lawmakers took to the streets in fight against irregular government policies.In the same vein, recent candlelit vigils that mobilized more than 15 million Koreans in response to the scandals of former president Park Geun-hye erupted in late October, was no isolated event, according to two American scholars.UCLA Center for Korean Studies director John Duncan (center) / Gangbuk-gu Office""Candlelight demonstrations, and the way they successfully brought about the impeachment of former president Park Geun-hye, gave me a great hope for Korea's future,"" John Duncan, a director of the UCLA Center for Korean Studies, told The Korea Herald.Professor Duncan visited Seoul on Thursday to attend the International Conference on the April 19 Revolution.The conference was hosted by Gangbuk-gu Office in Seoul, in an aim to commemorate the significance of the revolution, which terminated the autocratic rule of Syngman Rhee.""Things in Korea (such as recent corruption scandals) have happened very dramatically and quickly that makes it so difficult for someone like me, a historian, to sit down and come up with a good analysis,"" said Duncan, who has been teaching Korean history at the University of California since 1989.Mixed with unprecedented levels of anger and solidarity among South Koreans, the result was explosive.Citizens holding candles pushed the parliament to vote to impeach Park on Dec. 9, 2016 over a corruption scandal involving Park's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. It was upheld by the Constitutional Court on March 10, which many hailed as a victory for the people.Meanwhile, Paul Chang, an assistant professor of Sociology at Harvard University, defined the recent impeachment a ""triumph of democracy"" in the interview.Chang, who also attended the conference on Thursday as a main speaker, said that the incident was one of the exemplary cases in an impressive cohort of young democracies.Harvard University sociology assistant professor Paul Chang / Gangbuk-gu Office""The combination of the size of protests and the peaceful nature of the gatherings was the most impressive.""The large scale candlelight demonstrations changed people's perception of what's possible in Korean society, said Chang.""Even less than a year ago, protests have been quite violent. It was so violent that the instinctive response from the police was to confront protest very severely or harshly. But I think this protest showed a different paradigm,"" he said.In the polarized society where conservatives and liberals are distinctively divided, recent demonstrations showed ""some kind of coalition among different sectors of society or coming together,"" according to Chang.Duncan said that ""for Koreans, what strengthens and advances democracy is citizen's participation.""Duncan and Chang shared the view that political parties should reflect the voices of voters in a responsible manner.""In short-term, citizens can vote, meet your congressperson, protest within a rule of law, and participate through institutional mechanisms.""But in the long-term, it is education. Educate your children so that society is not about money or competition, but about achieving a greater good. Though we easily forget, it is a lot easier to have a new generation of people who think about the good of a whole, as an individual, if not, how are you going to have any function of democracy?"" Chang asked.Duncan stressed that another mission for Korea's democratization is unification.""I believe that reunification is absolutely necessary for the nation's long-term soundness and autonomy of the divided nations,"" Duncan said.Responsibility and role now lies in the new government that will take office in less than a month, he says.""As far as I'm concerned, that is why it is important that the new government is genuinely committed toward resolving issues between South and North Korea, moving in a positive and effective way toward reunification,"" said Duncan.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DEMOCRACIES (92%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (90%); CORRUPTION (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); POLITICS (90%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (89%); POLITICAL CORRUPTION (89%); SCANDALS (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); IMPEACHMENT (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); SOCIOLOGY (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (87%); HISTORY (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (76%); MILITARY RULE (71%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (LOS ANGELES) (83%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (96%); UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: April 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Pioneering the smartphone photo taking and sharing frontier, Instagram was one of the very first apps to introduce readymade photo filters that rendered Photoshop near outdated.Korea's online giant Naver quickly followed up with homegrown Pholar, but it failed to catch on.With Instagram, casual snaps taken on mobile phones can be transformed into artistic images and instantly shared with the world.Readymade photo filters transform mobile snaps into art works. (Lim Jeong-yeo/The Korea Herald)Originally limited to iPhones only, Instagram's user community nonetheless swelled to 1 million within two months of its release.Around a similar time in 2011, the number of monthly active users spiraled to 10 million and skyrocketed to 300 million by the end of 2014.In December 2016 the total number of MAUs amounted to 600 million, according to the company.As for Koreans, data compiled by Instagram in March showed that there are over 6 million active users here.The application has now become an ingrained part of Koreans' lifestyle. In 2014, the National Institute of Korean Language picked ""Mukstagram"" as one of the most noteworthy new words of the year as it defines ""the act of posting photos of the food one is having on social media."" Albeit the feathered description referred to social media at large, the suffix ""-stagram"" unmistakably highlighted Instagram.In 2011 Apple made the app the iPhone App of the Year. Four months later a brand new version was launched for Android devices. Soon after that, Instagram was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion.According to Facebook Korea's Communications Manager Sean Park, Facebook and Instagram create separate yet mutually complimentary types of social media.While Facebook allows interactions between friends and close acquaintances, Instagram links people who would otherwise be irrelevant to each other if not for their common interests.Facebook content centers around text with photos, videos and article links. But for Instagram, everything revolves around images and videos.Hashtags that usually accompany Instagram content serve as search words for people who navigate the platform for visual information on where to eat, what products to purchase and places to visit -- all the content is trusted to have been tested and proven by those who have experienced it.The application makes sure its users get the information they want by using algorithms that act as a ""mobile concierge."" It tailors the content exposed to the users to show them what they want to see based on their previous footprints on the web.Instagram tailors its contents for each individual users. (Photo provided by Instagram)Instagram is continuously adding more filters, stickers and special effects. It has recently added zoom-in features for photos, as well as extending the time limit on the videos from the previous 15 seconds to 1 minute. Direct messaging between users is new, too.Instagram spinoff applications Boomerang, Hyperlapse and Layout aids faster and easier editing for photos and videos. Boomerang helps create a video that plays endlessly by reverse-playing the clip, Hyperlapse makes time lapse filming easy and Layout helps stick as many as nine photographs together in a single frame.Park said the app will continue to evolve in 2017.While Instagram carefully choreographs its developments, there are some that even its own developers did not intend or foresee.Now that it has almost conquered the field of self-expression, Instagram is turning in to a burgeoning marketplace where people trade secondhand goods and handmade crafts.People who enjoy a prominent presence on Instagram are now what the ""power bloggers"" of search portals Naver and Daum used to be in Korea. Instagram accounts with a large number of followers are given gifts from merchandisers to promote their products on social media.Blogs still maintain a reputable position in the online marketing industry but their powers are waning in the face of more accessible social media that is not limited to one individual country but is dispersed throughout the world.Park said Instagram does not inhibit users from pursuing economic activities on the social media platform, as long as the contents they post up are authentic and not offensive.By Lim Jeong-yeo (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING (91%); TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT (90%); PHOTOGRAPHY (90%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); SMARTPHONES (90%); SOCIAL MEDIA (89%); MOBILE DEVICES (78%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (78%); MOBILE APPLICATIONS (78%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (76%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (70%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (66%)COMPANY: FACEBOOK INC (53%)TICKER: FB (NASDAQ) (53%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (53%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)LOAD-DATE: January 1, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chulAsia investment bank to start second meeting this weekJEJU -- Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong is confident in the success of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) meeting, which will start Friday for a three-day run.Around 2,000 bureaucrats, bankers, businesspeople and journalists from over 80 countries are expected to take part in the second annual gathering of the multilateral investment bank that opened early last year.'Welcome to Jeju, the treasure island of the world. It is a great honor for us to host the second AIIB meeting,' Won said in a recent interview with The Korea Times.'I hope participants will discuss various topics for the good of all humanity, not just for their own interests. Then, the global citizens will come up with support.'He is sure the meeting will achieve such goals.The 53-year-old governor said Jeju will also benefit greatly from the AIIB event.'Jeju will be able to establish itself as a capable host of global conferences. We hope to eventually become a competitor of Monaco of France and Basel of Switzerland,' he said.'In addition, we vie to attract infrastructure investments. Foreign investors have channeled around 15 trillion won ($13.29 billion) in 24 projects. We target high-tech and entertainment sectors.'Specifically, Won picked a series of promising businesses such as information-communication technology, bio, energy, healthcare and theme parks.Eco-friendly islandGovernor Won vies to show how eco-friendly the scenic resort island is to the high-profile AIIB participants.In particular, Jeju has an advanced infrastructure for electric cars -- around 10,000 electric-powered vehicles run here, the highest number in Korea. In a decade, Jeju hopes to drive out all conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.It is part of the '2030 carbon-free island' initiative, the brainchild of Won who took office in 2014.'In 2030, Jeju will have 370,000 cars. We strive to have all cars powered by electricity by that year,' said Won, who was also a three-term lawmaker.'By 2030, we will also meet all of our power demand via renewable energies such as solar and wind power without resorting to thermoelectric or nuclear power plants.'Such efforts, which Won calls 'green big bang,' are expected to make Jeju the host of an eco-friendly smart city that involves futuristic technologies including homes, plants, roads and information technology.He also predicted the program would create an ecosystem for the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.'The world keeps an eye on our pilot project, which was demonstrated through a series of international conferences. Plus, the model can be benchmarked by thousands of cities across the world,' he said.AIIB President Jin Liqun also praised Jeju's eco-friendly initiatives ahead of the second conference whose theme is 'Sustainable Infrastructure.''Jeju is the perfect backdrop for the topic of sustainable infrastructure. It is a great example of how a city can successfully integrate sustainable practices into its operations,' he said in an email interview.The world's top electric carmaker Tesla fixes its eyes on Jeju, which is already equipped with necessary infrastructure for electric vehicles including chargers across the island.In line with the policy, Korea's top carmaker Hyundai Motor would provide its Ioniq electric cars to participants of the AIIB.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERVIEWS (92%); INVESTMENT BANKING (90%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (86%); CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY (86%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (86%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (78%); ISLANDS & REEFS (75%); SOLAR ENERGY (69%); POWER PLANTS (69%); WIND ENERGY (69%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS (69%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (69%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (69%); ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY (69%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (67%); MOTOR VEHICLES (67%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (64%); AMUSEMENT & THEME PARKS (64%); GASOLINE (61%); GOVERNORS (58%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (50%)CITY: BASEL, SWITZERLAND (71%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); ASIA (92%); SWITZERLAND (71%); FRANCE (71%); MONACO (70%)LOAD-DATE: June 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

He also gives policy advice to the central government in Beijing on North Korea matters.In an interview with The Korea Herald, the Korean-Chinese academic argued that similar to relations governing China and Taiwan, more cooperation and exchange between the two Koreas would cultivate amity toward integration. In this vein, the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-century Maritime Silk Road plan, simply known as the ??One Belt, One Road,?? would be an ideal vehicle to materialize future cooperation, he said on the sidelines of an academic seminar in Busan. ??When one side declares unification as its policy, unification will never come,?? the 53-year-old said Friday following a conference organized by the Korean Association for Local Government Studies at Dong-a University in Busan, which gathered nearly 100 scholars and policy advisers in Korea. ??It??s obvious. Exchange and collaboration are prerequisite to peaceful unification. Unification could follow given enough efforts to mend fences.??Yanbian University is located in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin province, and is the only university in China using Korean as an official language of instruction alongside Chinese. The school has affiliations with universities in South Korea and North Korea. The belt and road initiative, which Chinese President Xi Jinping triumphantly touted at the maiden summit in Beijing on May 14, summoned 28 world leaders, including a North Korean delegation. The $124 billion scheme aims to forge ??paths of peace, inclusiveness and free trade?? across Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond through infrastructure development and systems of ??fair, reasonable and transparent global trade and investment rules.??Some Asian countries, notably India, did not participate, leery of Beijing??s growing regional clout that could encroach their sphere of influence. To address these concerns, Xi said in his opening speech, ??We are ready to share practices of development with other countries, but harbor no intention to interfere in their internal affairs, export our social system, or impose our will on others.????What we hope to achieve is a new model of win-win cooperation,?? Xi contended.Analysts note that China aims to offer an alternative model of global development previously championed by the US, and also find new solutions to slowing growth at home by exporting its infrastructure development expertise that has spearheaded three decades of rapid domestic growth. ??Xi??s vision is creating a global community of a common destiny,?? the professor explained, adding the undertaking could extend to the Korean Peninsula through both land and sea. ??If North Korea and South Korea took part in the initiative through railways and seaborne routes, it would greatly benefit all participating economies.??Regarding the new administration of President Moon Jae-in, Fang said his diplomatic balancing will be difficult between Washington and Beijing, complicated by the deployment of a US anti-missile system in Korea. Although the new leader would try to improve ties with Pyongyang by inheriting the ??Sunshine Policy?? of his predecessors Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, the volatile situations surrounding the peninsula stemming from the North??s advancing nuclear capabilities would be a major stumbling block, he forecast.??Reconciliation might be possible with North Korea but we shouldn??t harbor such high hopes,?? the professor advised.More fundamentally, he floated the possibility that the recent demand made by President Donald Trump to Seoul to pay $1 billion for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system -- although denied by his national security adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster -- would be covertly factored into the bilateral defense cost-sharing agreement. ??There are many undisclosed ways the US could foot the bill to Korea,?? he said, adding maintaining the system would be costly for years to come. ??South Korea investing in and strengthening its own defense capabilities would be much more effective in terms of both the objective and cost.??As for Beijing??s stance on THAAD, Fang said the Communist Party views the weapons system as the US?? tool to encircle China, a furtherance of Washington??s ??pivot to Asia?? strategy and part of its larger military structures across the Asia-Pacific region. ??We see it not for protecting Korea, as thousands of missiles coming at once won??t be effectively shot down. THAAD is ultimately for shielding the US mainland from incoming missiles.??Emphasizing that the West??s sanctions have bolstered the North??s self-reliance and resilience, the academic said China views its wayward neighbor??s state of affairs with pity and concern, but that North Korea could not emulate China??s market-oriented reform and opening either. ??Every country has different problems and circumstances,?? according to Fang. ??Pyongyang is not in a situation to open itself, nor can it even if it wanted to. The outside world demands as a precondition its denuclearization, but the regime will not fall for that under current circumstances. The conditio sine qua non are greatly entangled.??By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (89%); EXPORT TRADE (89%); GLOBALIZATION (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (89%); INFRASTRUCTURE (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (77%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (76%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (74%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (71%); INTERVIEWS (69%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (65%)PERSON: XI JINPING (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (93%); BEIJING, CHINA (92%); PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (94%); JILIN, CHINA (79%); NORTHEAST CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: CHINA (97%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); ASIA (92%); TAIWAN (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPE (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

The Seoul Central District Court partially ruled in favor of five English teachers who filed a suit in September 2015 against their former employer, a private language education chain in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province which refused to acknowledge them as regular employees and offer severance pay. The group is made up of three US citizens, one South Korean and one Canadian.The verdict ordered the institute to give the plaintiffs a total of 187 million won ($167,000) in severance pay, along with compensation for unused annual leave and vacation.In court, the institute??s attorneys argued the teachers were hired under ??service contracts for instructors,?? which provide wages at an hourly rate and consider them privately contracted workers. The contracts did not stipulate basic or fixed pay and a guaranteed registration of social insurance programs, nor require them to pay earned income tax. The team also insisted benefits like pensions were already included in the wage package. But the court dismissed such claims, stating that the terms of the contracts represented an ??archetypal?? employer-employee relationship. ??The contract terms on codes of conduct regarding termination of contract, probation, and workplace punctuality policies represent the nature of direct employment,?? the verdict reads. ??Thus the contract should be viewed as an official labor contract.??By Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEACHING & TEACHERS (91%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); LITIGATION (90%); VERDICTS (90%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (90%); SEVERANCE PAY (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); EMPLOYMENT (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); HOLIDAY & VACATION LEAVE (78%); EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); EMPLOYEE LEAVE (78%); LABOR & EMPLOYMENT LAW (78%); LAWYERS (75%); SUITS & CLAIMS (73%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (73%); TEACHER RECRUITMENT & HIRING (73%); ETHICS (72%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); CANADA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

'Being located near Seorae Village, a French village where a huge French population resides, we wanted our students to develop a global mindset,' said Lee Jae-hyo, Seocho High School vice principal, explaining the purpose of the two schools' activities.Lee also explained that although the sports competition is a new event, the schools have had many smaller events of its kind. In May last year, they held a joint Olympiad where students competed in basketball, football and track events, as well as Petanque, a traditional French game played in the southern region with hollow steel balls and a small wooden one. This year's event is different in that it is larger and more formal.The exchange has been mutually beneficial, especially in the language department. Just a few years ago, for example, French was not offered as a second language in Seocho High School, explained Kim Jong-cheol, who is a French teacher there. In addition to the language, Korean students have also been active in learning about French culture, arts and geography.He said their ties have also led to tangible achievements. Seocho High School students won first place in a nationwide French quiz contest 'Francophonie' for high school students and second place at the 2017 nationwide competition on French culture.'Many students live in the same village, and prior to these exchanges they weren't making use of the resources out there. Now, they are able to learn languages from each other and also interact, thereby bringing peace to the community as a whole,' Kim said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); HIGH SCHOOLS (89%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); MULTILINGUALISM (78%); SPORTS (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); SPORTS & RECREATION (78%); OLYMPICS (78%); BASKETBALL (73%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (73%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (73%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (56%)PERSON: ADAM SILVER (90%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: FRANCE (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (91%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)LOAD-DATE: September 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

His performance was composed and humble. He did not dodge questions and answered fairly, leaving his inquisitors almost empty-handed.When lawmakers repeatedly pressed him on an allegation that his son evaded military service with a possibly fake health condition, Lee calmly explained that a shoulder injury and multiple pituitary surgeries kept him from serving.He responded with such remarks as 'As a father, I feel terribly bad that my son is being talked about as such,' 'He has no choice but to live as a sinner.'The main opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP) lawmakers also pushed the allegation that Lee's art teacher and painter wife temporarily changed her address to Gangnam, Seoul's wealthy suburb, to be assigned to one of the schools in the district in 1989.Lee immediately conceded that she attempted to do so, saying 'I'm sorry I did not notice it until the hearing.'He also said he feels 'miserable' and 'It was done based on a very silly thought.'Meanwhile, some lawmakers sought repeatedly to get a fix on the nominee's view about a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery deployed in the southeastern part of the country.When asked if he would review the decision-making process about its deployment by the previous Park Geun-hye government, Lee said he intends to 'investigate' the background of the decision.'Factors to be considered are national security, the Korea-U.S. alliance, Korea-China relations, and procedural legitimacy. There was a flaw in the procedure so the plan reached a deadlock,' he said. 'The former government had cited nothing was decided or discussed, but later announced its deployment, placing unnecessary strain on Korea-China relations.'He also agreed with liberal lawmakers on the need to seek parliamentary approval before pushing the deployment of the system.'He might have some issues about his family members, but there were no grounds for disqualification regarding his own life,' a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea who attended the hearing said, speculating there would be no trouble in endorsing his appointment.'Also, we highly appreciate his intention to become a more responsible and power-sharing prime minister and foster cooperative politics.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIME MINISTERS (92%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (92%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); APPROVALS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); JOURNALISM (76%); TESTIMONY (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (66%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (60%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"115","What makes a human?",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"August","What makes a human?  Korea Times August 8, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesAugust 8, 2017 TuesdayWhat makes a human?BYLINE: By Kevin LalandLENGTH: 1065 wordsST ANDREWS, SCOTLAND - Last month, moviegoers flocked to theaters to see War for the Planet of the Apes, in which an army of retrovirus-modified primates wage war against humanity. Chimpanzees on horseback, machine-gun-wielding gorillas, and scholarly orangutans undoubtedly make for good theater. But could anything like this ever happen in real life?In 'Planet of the Apes,' Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel upon which the films are based, space traveler Ulysse Merou is stranded on a terrifying planet ruled by gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees who have copied their former human masters' language, culture, and technology. The humans, meanwhile, have degenerated into brutal and unsophisticated beasts.Much of the sinister realism in 'Planet of the Apes' stems from Boulle's impressive attention to scientific detail and knowledge of research into animal behavior at that time. His book tapped into the still-popular notion that animals such as chimpanzees and dolphins have complex but covert communication systems that humans cannot even fathom. Many people would prefer to think that all those 'arrogant' scientists who have concluded that animals cannot talk have simply failed to decode animals' calls.But Boulle's book is decidedly a work of fiction, because apes here on Earth could never actually acquire human culture solely through imitation. In reality, complex culture requires underlying biological capabilities that are fashioned over long periods of evolution. Chimpanzees simply do not have the vocal control or physiology to produce speech.Moreover, modern apes could not be made highly intelligent even with brain-enhancing drugs. And although microbes can change behavior - such as when rabies renders its host violent and aggressive - they could never bestow language upon a species.We know this because animal communication has been investigated extensively for more than a century, and the scientific evidence yields few hints of truly complex communication faculties in non-human species. For example, in the 1940s, researchers raised a chimpanzee named Viki in their home. But Viki learned just four words - 'mama,' 'papa,' 'cup,' and 'up' - which was more than could be said for an earlier experiment in which a chimpanzee and a human child were reared together. That exercise had to be abandoned after the chimpanzee failed to learn a single word, and the child actually started imitating chimpanzee sounds.In the following decades, studies teaching apes sign language generated much excitement. And yet virtually all linguists would agree that the apes in these experiments had not produced language. They could memorize the meanings of signs, but they could not learn the rules of grammar.Tellingly, utterances by 'talking' apes proved to be exceedingly egocentric. When equipped with the means to talk, apes' communications are limited to expressions of desire such as 'Gimme food.' The longest recorded statement of any 'talking' ape, by a chimpanzee named Nim Chimpsky, was, 'Give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you.' It turns out that chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas make for poor conversationalists.Many scholars believe that language emerged from the use of meaningful signs. Our ancestors were immersed in a symbol-rich world, and this generated evolutionary feedback favoring the neural structures that enable us to manipulate symbols efficiently. The syntax in human language today was made possible by our ancestors' long use of symbolic proto-languages. Genes and culture coevolved to reorganize the human brain.The same is true of warfare, which is much more than just scaled-up aggression. In war, complex institutions dictate strict behavioral codes and individual roles that facilitate cooperation. Research suggests that this level of cooperation could not evolve in a species that lacked a complex culture and such features as institutionalized punishment and socially sanctioned retaliation.Most of these norms are not obvious, and thus have to be inculcated, usually during youth. But even among apes that are proficient imitators, there is little compelling evidence that behavior is actively taught. When apes do cooperate, it is largely to help relatives. The scale of human cooperation, which involves huge numbers of unrelated individuals working together, is unprecedented largely because it is built upon learned and socially transmitted norms.There is now extensive evidence that our ancestors' cultural activities changed the human brain through natural selection, which then further enhanced our cultural capabilities in recurring cycles. For instance, milk-drinking began with early Neolithic humans, who were consequently exposed to strong selection favoring genes that break down energy-rich lactose. This genetic-cultural coevolution explains why many of us with pastoralist ancestors are lactose tolerant.It is little wonder that Boulle put such an emphasis on imitation. Humans are descended from a long line of imitators, who mimicked each other's fear responses to identify predators and avoid danger. Today, this is reflected in empathy and other forms of emotional contagion that make movies a heartfelt experience. Without these traits, we would all watch movies like sociopaths, equally unmoved by a murder or a kiss.It was also through imitation that our forebears learned how to butcher carcasses, build fires, and make digging tools, spears, and fishing hooks. These and countless other skills left us supremely adapted to decipher others' movements, and reproduce them with our own muscles, tendons, and joints. Eons later, today's movie stars demonstrate the same aptitude when imitating the movements of other primates, with a precision that no other species can match.Human culture, having evolved over millennia, is not something that another species can easily pick up. We can rest assured that there will be no inter-primate war on Earth. For that to happen, another species would have to undergo a similarly prolonged evolutionary journey. And the only real warmongering ape on the planet seems hell-bent on preventing that.Kevin Laland is professor of Behavioral and Evolutionary Biology at the University of St Andrews, U.K., and author of 'Darwin's Unfinished Symphony: How Culture Made the Human Mind.'

It also calls for social life classes to deal with Tokyo's ""efforts to peacefully resolve"" the issues.The newly-unveiled education guidline of Japan stipulates Dokdo islets as ""indigenous Japanese territory."" YonhapSeoul lodged a strong complaint, blasting the claim as a ""provocation"" and urging its instant retraction. Hideo Suzuki, a minister at the Japanese Embassy, was called in by Chung Byung-won, director general for Northeast Asian affairs at the Foreign Ministry here.""We cannot refrain from deploring that Japan repeated its unjust claim over Dokdo and demand its immediate withdrawal,"" ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said in a statement.""The Japanese government must realize that the latest amendment will not only instill incorrect perceptions about territory in its future generations, but only cause negative effects in the development of the two countries' future-oriented relations.""Tokyo revises the guideline every 10 years in general and last amended it in 2008. It is expected to introduce its final edition in March after a public review period. It would then take effect in 2020 for elementary schools and 2021 for middle schools.The latest update reflects the Shinzo Abe government's efforts to match its sovereignty claims in the top educational manual along the lines of its teachers' handbook, modified in 2014, and existing schoolbooks.Currently all 19 versions of middle school social studies textbooks and four elementary school textbooks carry the Dokdo claim, according to Seoul officials.The present handbook also calls for schools to ""clearly remind"" students in geography courses the islets, there known as Takeshima, are ""indigenous Japanese territory but illegally occupied by Korea."" History teachers are required to mention how Japan incorporated Dokdo based on ""rational grounds under international law.""This marks a sharply toughened statement over its previous version in 2008 that merely said ""there is a difference"" between Korea and Japan on their views on Dokdo.""The Dokdo claim is not new as it has already been included in the existing guidebook and schoolbooks, but the draft has significance in that it is the highest-level teaching manual,"" a Foreign Ministry official here told reporters on customary condition of anonymity.""We will never accept and sternly respond to any territorial provocation, monitoring the draft and upcoming final guideline's practical impact on the chalkface and the Japanese government's intention to make Dokdo a disputed area.""At the height of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Tokyo illicitly annexed Dokdo to install communication and surveillance devices and collect intelligence on Russian naval movements. Japan returned the islets to Korea after winning the war, but then soon pushed to occupy the entire peninsula.The Abe administration has been ratcheting up its sovereignty assertions via diplomatic and defense papers, teaching and schoolbook guidelines and other methods.The latest development dealt another blow to bilateral relations, which have been going downhill since Tokyo called its Ambassador to Korea Yasumasa Nagamine to return home last month in protest against the installment in front of the Japanese consulate-general in Busan of a new statue representing Korean women forced into front-line sex slavery during Japanese rule.The historical tensions led to Tokyo's territorial provocations, with even its Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida renewing the Dokdo claim after provincial assemblymen here floated a plan to launch another memorial there.With little signs of a thaw, the mood is likely to remain icy when Seoul's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se meets with Kishida on the sidelines of the Group of 20 ministerial conference later this week in Bonn, Germany.""No matter what, it's better to sit down and talk than not,"" another ministry official said.

It looked, in fact, like an imperial durbar -- the sort of grand spectacle that the British in India used to arrange periodically, with princelings from across the subcontinent turning up to pay their respects to the Raj.Many, of course, would contest this comparison. The Belt and Road initiative, China??s grand plan to build trade-supporting infrastructure across the world, is being sold as a cooperative enterprise. Partner governments will, of course, have a say in what projects are approved and under what financial terms.Even so, there are good reasons for disquiet. For one thing, the whole poorly-defined initiative might fail, burdening weak nations with unsustainable debt and stressing the Chinese economy. But even otherwise, it might ensnare China and its client states in something that will look perilously like a 21st century empire.This shouldn??t come as a surprise. Few empires were consciously created. The British Empire may not have been born in a ??fit of absence of mind,?? as John Robert Seeley famously claimed, but it wasn??t exactly planned in advance, either. And we know from history how nations stumble into their imperial obligations. Trade follows domestic prosperity (or, in China??s case, enables it). Infrastructure follows trade.That infrastructure is vulnerable to local security threats. Forts -- or more modern forms of power projection -- are built to respond to those threats. Political interference follows power projection and boots on the ground follow that.As Peter Frankopan, the writer of a superb history of the original Silk Road, has pointed out: The process of acceleration -- from (economic) partners to having privileged positions to administrators and rulers -- was one echoed in many parts of the world that Europe came into contact with -- empire was not part of a European master plan. It just so happened that opportunities kept opening up which were too good to miss out on.It??s easy to see how this centuries-old dynamic could play out today in places like Central Asia.Perhaps the problem is that nobody studies the history of empires any more. They??ve been airbrushed out of the history of the West, where British Trade Minister Liam Fox could quite incredibly claim that ??the United Kingdom is one of the few countries ... that does not need to bury its 20th century history.?? And China is one of the only two Asian countries never to be really colonized, although huge swathes of the country were occupied by the Japanese.But the leaders of China??s Communist Party should at least have read Lenin -- and particularly the 1917 book that explains imperialism as ??the highest stage of capitalism.?? When capital and productive capacity builds up at home in excess of its ability to earn returns, Lenin argued, it must seek monopoly power and therefore returns elsewhere, which is how imperial projects come to be. Surely the parallels to the Belt and Road -- justified in part by the need for giant state-controlled Chinese companies to utilize their overcapacity -- are obvious.A 21st-century empire would not look like those that came before. After all, did the East India Company look anything like the Ottomans, even when it ruled a fifth of humanity? It may be entirely true, as Belt-and-Road defenders like London School of Economics lecturer Keyu Jin have argued, that China??s ??intentions are far from malicious.?? But history has a way of rendering intentions irrelevant.Facts on the ground -- facts like unpaid debts, like terrorist attacks on your workers, like the threat of expropriation -- can change one??s thinking swiftly and reasonably enough. And the initial benefits of the scheme -- financing for infrastructure in a capital-starved developing world -- might seem powerful enough to obscure worries about the future.As anyone in India can tell you, a controlled political environment is a big advantage when it comes to completing an infrastructure project. China??s enviable and near-unique success in this field has emerged from its own special circumstances: control of savings, control of land and control of political consequences.But when its infrastructure-building projects fail to provide the returns that they should, when messy local politics begin to interfere with their construction and operation, then how will China??s companies and governments respond? Will they not blame the problems on failed local systems and attempt to correct those systems, to bring them into greater harmony with the successful system China has developed back home?Infrastructure, throughout history, has never been a purely economic game. From Roman roads to American railroads to the Raj??s railways, they??ve influenced and been influenced by politics. We should not fear the economic failure of China??s grand scheme. We should worry about what will be required for it to succeed.By Mihir SharmaMihir Sharma is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); POLITICS (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (70%); HISTORY (67%); WRITERS (63%); BUSINESS COOPERATIVES (55%)PERSON: XI JINPING (78%); LIAM FOX (58%)COUNTRY: CHINA (98%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); INDIA (92%); ASIA (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); CENTRAL ASIA (79%); EUROPE (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

He also identified a fifth person of interest, named as 50-year-old Ri Ji-u, and showed pictures of two North Koreans wanted by the government but not identified by name.The revelation came amid the speculation that Kim Jong-nam was assassinated by North Korean agents under the instruction of Kim Jong-un who has long viewed his flamboyant, outspoken elder brother as a threat to his dictatorial power.When asked by the reporters whether the communist regime was behind the killing, the deputy chief said ""the suspects are all North Korean,"" indicating that Pyongyang played a significant role in what South Korean officials described as ""assassination.""""We believe North Korea is behind the murder of Kim Jong-nam,"" Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at Seoul's Ministry of the Unification, said on Sunday after the press conference. """"North Korea has conducted criminal, terrorism activity against humanity.""Earlier in the day, The New Straits Times, an English-language newspaper in Malaysia, quoted an unidentified senior police official as saying that the investigator had ""solid"" evidence that can draw the death of Kim Jong-nam to a North Korean citizen identified as Ri Jong-chol who was arrested on Saturday.The fourth suspect to be detained in connection to the death of Kim, Ri was apprehended at an apartment located in downtown Kuala Lumpur. When being arrested, he was carrying an ""I-Kad"" an official identification card issued to foreign workers that said his name is Ri Jong-chol.The newspaper reported that Ri could be an operative of the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau which manages the communist state's clandestine operations, saying the place he was arrested had been used as a ""safehouse"" for North Korean agents in Malaysia since 2011.The Malaysian police has also been trying to ascertain the authenticity of Ri's identification card, which has low security features and could be easily forged, said the newspaper. The police are investigating into the possibility that he forged the document to hide his real identity.""Unless they are high-profile officials and secret agents, it is unlikely to live abroad independently,"" said a South Korean official familiar with North Korea's intelligence operation. ""It is quite likely that Ri was assigned a special operation.""Ri is the fourth suspect to be detained in the death of Kim, who died on his way to hospital within minutes after being sprayed with poison by two women as he waited to board a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.The two women -- identified as 28-year-old Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong and 25-year-old Indonesian Siti Aisha -- told the police they thought the attack was part of a comedy show prank and rehearsed the scene to get it right for the video.Tito Karnavian, Indonesia's most senior policeman, said the two women had already performed the prank on other men before attacking Kim. It involved convincing them to close their eyes before spraying them with water.""Such an action was done three or four times and they were given a few dollars for it, and with the last target, Kim Jong-nam, allegedly there were dangerous materials in the sprayer,"" Karnavian told reporters on FridayOne Indonesian newspaper reported that Aisha was approached by a mysterious man at the Kuala Lumpur nightclub and offered $100 to be involved in a prank. Her 26-year-old Malaysian boyfriend was also arrested by police as an alleged accomplice. Police are hunting for other alleged accomplices.North Korea, meanwhile, has accused the Malaysian government of conducting a ""hostile"" investigation against the reclusive regime, saying that they would reject the outcome of autopsy on the body believed to be Kim Jong-nam.In his first public statement on the case, North Korean Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol said that North Korea would ""categorically reject"" the results of the autopsy, which he said was performed despite its objections and with its officials excluded.""The Malaysian side forced the postmortem without our permission and witnessing, we will categorically reject the result of the postmortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance,"" Kang saidThe ambassador also called for the body, whose identity he did not mention, to be released immediately because the deceased was traveling on a diplomatic passport and therefore should be under North Korea's consular protection.Earlier Friday, Malaysian police said that the body would not be handed over to the North Korean embassy until a family member could supply a matching DNA sample. So far, no family member or next of kin has come forward to identify or claim the body, according to the Malaysian police.By Yeo Jun-suk (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POLICE FORCES (92%); MURDER (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); DEATH & DYING (89%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); ARRESTS (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (76%); TERRORISM (70%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (88%)CITY: KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA (89%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (99%); MALAYSIA (97%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: March 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Nestled among the gleaming buildings are maze-like alleys that appear to have escaped the passage of time. The Korea Herald explores the many nooks and crannies of Seoul, proclaimed the capital of Joseon in 1392, that reveal a multifaceted city. -- Ed.Navigating through the Haebangchon neighborhood of Yongsan can be a challenge. Houses are perched on steep hills. Cars squeeze past labyrinthine roads while pedestrians walk dangerously close to the traffic. It's an inconvenient neighborhood in many ways, and hard to reach by public transportation.But cafes, exotic eateries and artists' studios have been popping up there since as early as 2006, turning it into a trendy hangout spot. Owners remodel old buildings to save costs, turning shabby properties into fashionably vintage ones.As of 2016, about one-tenth of the area's 13,000 residents are foreign, according to the local Yongsan-gu Office. The initial reason for the area's rise was one based on practicality -- its proximity to the booming Itaewon and Gyeongridan areas, but with cheaper rent, real estate agents say.""There's a quiet charm here now,"" said Kim Hyo-min, a 24-year-old art student browsing in a small shop Thursday. ""It's more relaxed than the rest of Seoul.""A view of Haebangchon (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)""Haebang"" means ""liberation"" in Korean; the area got its name after people returning from abroad or fleeing from the North settled there, following Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945.Haebangchon was home to a throng of knitting factories in the '60s and '70s. In the '90s, the neighborhood began to wane as its landmark Sinheung traditional market and surrounding stores went out of business, unable to withstand the onslaught of large retail chains. And in the 2010s, after a decade of stagnation, low rent drew in artists who needed studio space and foreign nationals looking for affordable accommodations.In 2014, Seoul Metropolitan Government announced plans to revive the area. Last year, the landlords of Sinheung market signed a rent-control pact effected through 2022, and leatherwork and soy candle studios, a tailor and other artisan shops have opened in the former market.""This year, we'll be renovating the alleys inside the market and its roof,"" said Han Gwang-ya, a professor of architecture at Dongguk University leading the initiative to revive Haebangchon. ""For now, our goal is to spruce up the infrastructure there.""A sign stands in front of Goyo Bookstore, one of a handful of small bookstores that have popped up in Haebangchon, last Friday. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Customers browse Goyo Bookstore, one of a handful of small bookstores that have popped up in Haebangchon, last Friday. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Recently, the more remote corners of the neighborhood have become home to a number of small, independent bookstores.Celebrities and artists have begun frequenting the area as well. Placed on a shelf in Goyo Bookshop, situated on a high hilltop near Haebang Church, is a signed copy of Man Booker awardee Han Kang's ""The Vegetarian"" dedicated to the store. Small notes carrying musings written by the owner are pasted on some of the books.Comedian Ro Hong-chul has set up a small bookstore here as well. Storage Book and Film is another bookstore with a variety of books that reflect the owners' tastes -- independent publications, translations of obscure foreign texts and works by up-and-coming writers.But the shop owners stress they aren't idealistic dreamers: Their goal is to make a living, however small, off their book sales. Like the neighborhood, their stores are a mix of artistic sensitivity and necessity.""I want to rebut views that highlight the bookstore as a 'pure' space of culture that doesn't consider profits,"" writes the owner of Goyo Bookshop in an essay published in a local magazine's November 2016 issue. ""Selecting good books is the beginning of selling good books.""Haebangchon is still far from a lucrative neighborhood. ""It's not bustling with customers on weekdays.

"124","Economic crises and the crisis of economics",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Economic crises and the crisis of economics  Korea Times January 19, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesJanuary 19, 2017 ThursdayEconomic crises and the crisis of economicsBYLINE: By Paola SubacchiLENGTH: 985 wordsLONDON - Is the economics profession 'in crisis'? Many policymakers, such as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, believe that it is. Indeed, a decade ago, economists failed to see a massive storm on the horizon, until it culminated in the most destructive global financial crisis in nearly 80 years. More recently, they misjudged the immediate impact that the United Kingdom's Brexit vote would have on its economy.Of course, the post-Brexit forecasts may not be entirely wrong, but only if we look at the long-term impact of the Brexit vote. True, some economists expected the UK economy to collapse during the post-referendum panic, whereas economic activity proved to be rather resilient, with GDP growth reaching some 2.1% in 2016. But now that British Prime Minister Theresa May has implied that she prefers a 'hard' Brexit, a gloomy long-term prognosis is probably correct.Unfortunately, economists' responsibility for the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent recession extends beyond forecasting mistakes. Many lent intellectual support to the excesses that precipitated it, and to the policy mistakes - particularly insistence on fiscal austerity and disregard for widening inequalities - that followed it.Some economists have been led astray by intellectual arrogance: the belief that they can always explain real-world complexity. Others have become entangled in methodological issues - 'mistaking beauty for truth,' as Paul Krugman once observed - or have placed too much faith in human rationality and market efficiency.Despite its aspiration to the certainty of the natural sciences, economics is, and will remain, a social science. Economists systematically study objects that are embedded in wider social and political structures. Their method is based on observations, from which they discern patterns and infer other patterns and behaviors; but they can never attain the predictive success of, say, chemistry or physics.Human beings respond to new information in different ways, and adjust their behavior accordingly. Thus, economics cannot provide - nor should it claim to provide - definite insights into future trends and patterns. Economists can glimpse the future only by looking backwards, so their predictive power is limited to deducing probabilities on the basis of past events, not timeless laws.And because economics is a social science, it can readily be used to serve political and business interests. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, global economic growth and profits were so strong that everyone - from small investors to the largest banks - was blinded by the prospect of bigger gains.Economists employed by banks, hedge funds, and other businesses were expected to provide a short-term 'view' for their employers and clients; and to dispense their 'wisdom' to the general public through interviews and media appearances. Meanwhile, the economics profession was adopting more complex mathematical tools and specialized jargon, which effectively widened the gap between economists and other social scientists.Before the financial crisis, when so many private interests and profitable opportunities were at stake, many economists defended a growth model that was based more on 'irrational exuberance' than on sound fundamentals. Similarly, with respect to Brexit, many economists confused the referendum's long-term impact with its short-term effects, because they were rushing their predictions to fit the political debate.Owing to these and other mistakes, economists - and economics - have suffered a spectacular fall from grace. Once seen as modern witch doctors with access to exclusive knowledge, economists are now the most despised of all 'experts.'Where do we go from here? While we should appreciate Haldane's candid admission, apologizing for past mistakes is not enough. Economists, especially those involved in policy debates, need to be held explicitly accountable for their professional behavior. Toward that end, they should bind themselves with a voluntary code of conduct.Above all, this code should recognize that economics is too complex to be reduced to sound bites and rushed conclusions. Economists should pay closer attention to when and where they offer their views, and to the possible implications of doing so. And they should always disclose their interests, so that proprietary analysis is not mistaken for an independent perspective.Moreover, economic debates would benefit from more voices. Economics is a vast discipline that comprises researchers and practitioners whose work spans macro and micro perspectives and theoretical and applied approaches. Like any other intellectual discipline, it produces excellent, good, and mediocre output.But the bulk of this research does not filter into policymaking and decision-making circles, such as finance ministries, central banks, or international institutions. At the commanding heights, economic-policy debates remain dominated by a relatively small group of white men from American universities and think tanks, nearly all of them well-versed devotees of mainstream economics.The views held by this coterie are disproportionately represented in the mass media, through commentaries and interviews. But fishing for ideas in such a small and shallow pond leads to a circular and complacent debate, and it may encourage lesser-known economists to tailor their research to fit in.The public deserves - and needs - a marketplace of ideas in which mainstream and heterodox views are afforded equal attention and balanced discussion. To be sure, this will take courage, imagination, and dynamism - particularly on the part of journalists. But a fairer, more pluralistic discussion of economic ideas may be just what economists need as well.Paola Subacchi is Research Director of International Economics at Chatham House.

"126","A new anthology of poems by Korean-American poets:'Ebb and Flow'",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"May","A new anthology of poems by Korean-American poets:'Ebb and Flow'  Korea Times May 5, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesMay 5, 2017 FridayA new anthology of poems by Korean-American poets:'Ebb and Flow'BYLINE: By now, I feel like I am a little child in a candy store. At times, I am enjoying as if peeping through a beautiful kaleidoscope. I don't know which one I should choose to read next. Now that I have the book, I realize the joy I will be feeling when I read the poems one by one on my own cadence for a long time. It doesn't matter if they make me smile or cry.LENGTH: 1019 wordsCover for 'Ebb and Flow'By Dr. Kang Chang-wukA new anthology of poems, 'Ebb and Flow' has been published jointly by CreateSpace and Amazon.com. This book is unique in that it features the work of eight Korean-American poets translated into English. The poets are Korean-American, except one for whom English is a second language. Writing the poems and publishing the book must have been daunting, but they have done it. The English-language poems are nuanced and unique, and more importantly, express the poets' excellence and artistry. While these poets have already shown their gift of poetry in Korean, is the poems in this anthology are not just simple translations. They were written in English from scratch, which is an admirable and amazing feat.They say that early human beings originated from Central Africa and spread all over the world. People move constantly. When this generation of poets from Korea left their home, they probably did not think they would leave their homeland permanently. Once they arrived in America, however, they decided to settle down earnestly. Many well-known Koreans optimistically planted their roots down in their new homeland, creating not only new homes but also new towns where they live and work with their family and friends and where they tend vegetable gardens on which they have planted their heart and soul. Their contributions to American society are truly inspiring. In spite of all the hard work they already have on their plate, they also planted their literary souls on this land that adopted them. I'm impressed by their efforts to create a gift to the land that welcomed them. When we visit friends' homes, we bring them something beautiful, like flowers. Likewise, with this book, these poets have brought a bouquet of beautiful poems to their host country, which embraced them.The book's editor and the lead-off poet, Professor Choi Yearn Hong, wrote a poem with a message that is so real that it made me wonder whether I was simply reading the poem or whether I am discovering my own soul. Well, that happens when you are reading a poem that makes you feel that you share an understanding with the poet. My empathy for the poet was undeniable when I read his poem 'Son's sorrow.' Sure, the book is an anthology not only of the poets' work but also of their lives.Caring for your loved one, like your mother, should be done with the ultimate devotion from your heart, a lesson good Koreans learn from the teachings in filial piety. But not by good medical knowledge. In fact, some not well ripen medical knowledge might harm one and injure the heart and devotion of everyone. Professor Choi wanted to say so in this poem, but he hesitates, like a good poet and like a good son with pure love and devotion to his mom. As a doctor, I have had the privilege to give my patients some consolation. Anyone who has left his or her mother back in their homeland wish he or she could send her a love song. I see a few more love songs to mothers in this book, and some to fathers as well. All the poets yearn for something, and this yearning is their bread and butter. In this case more mother which also may connote the motherland. To me this is very Korean in the heart. We all remember Antonin Dvorak's yearning in his 'New World Symphony,' but he went home. Whenever I hear the main theme's melody, I immediately see my mom in the kitchen preparing my supper and waiting for me at sunset. This yearning is just too much to bear, but our poets persisted.The poets and the humanity! But then, this is the agony of our immigrants who left their beloved in their homeland, Korea. And there are too many stories to tell with this yearning, heartbreaking stories, and stories of sorrow and guilt as you try to console yourself with your warm tears.All the vicissitudes of Korean immigration to the Western hemisphere have been mixed with blessings and travails. Any of immigrant compatriot would cry with this poet. What a black-skinned man of Korean ancestry is thinking I cannot fathom, but he might have tried to forget what he does not know. Why? It might have been too painful to even momentarily contemplate. Did his grandfather tell him good stories about what a wonderful home he left behind? But this poet shares his heart that mixes with that of a black-skinned man. I am sure the poet cried, though he might not have taken his handkerchief out of his pocket.We lost a wonderful poet. I do not know if he had read his own poem printed on the beautiful book. He may have gone to his home, but I have been left behind walking on my turf with still thing to do. Dr. Byoung Kie Lee wrote the poem 'To My God,' starting with simple question 'Are you there in Heaven? /You have not answered me. I have sent you a message.../I have something to talk to you [about] ...' An earnest prayer and earnest yearning. Interestingly, God said He always responds to a request from a prayer. But Dr. Lee did not wait for Him to answer. He just decided to go to see Him directly. Or, God sent His angel to get Dr. Lee. Though we are saddened about him going away to his home, he left us with joy and sorrow at the same time. We can easily imagine him pounding his Master's bosom crying and at the same time enjoying His warm embrace. Well, that is how poets help us to sublimate our sorrow into joy. This is a Korean-American poet. A poet who is honest, who yearns for a home that is waiting for him or her, and who prays out loud but does not cry. Still, these poets never forget what they treasure, like the poem 'Hibiscus Flower.'Soon, they began enjoying their new adoptive world after a deep breath. They become wanderlusts seeking something in and out of their new world and recording their delight on their poems, notwithstanding the occasional pain and agony.I would like to recommend to everyone, anyone who can read in English, this beautiful, newly crafted creation in English, a collection of works by all the good poets from the new era, the Korean-American poets in the capital of the great country that embraced them.Kang Chang-wuk, M.D. is a psychiatrist and writer.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POETRY (91%); ASIAN AMERICANS (90%); WRITERS (90%); BOOK PUBLISHING (78%); LITERATURE (78%); MULTILINGUALISM (77%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (77%); LIFE FORMS (73%)COMPANY: AMAZON.COM INC (58%)TICKER: AMZN (NASDAQ) (58%)INDUSTRY: NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES (58%); SIC5961 CATALOG & MAIL-ORDER HOUSES (58%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: May 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Four years later, Gu is back with his new movie 'Haewon,' as a follow-up.Gu Ja-hywanThe word Haewon means resolving victims' deep sorrow. While Red Tomb focused on massacres which took place in the southern Gyeongsang area, where Gu is based as a journalist, his latest film uncovers tragic narratives all over the country.'I felt sorry for the many bereaved families when I filmed Red Tomb that primarily dealt with the so-called Bodo massacres during the 1950-53 Korean War,' Gu said in an interview with The Korea Times. 'The Bodo massacres are the tip of the iceberg. Most of the killings are not known to the public. Filming the movies, I sought advice of history professors and teachers, but they were not aware of some of the incidents.'Gu said the ignorance due to concealment is the reason for a lingering 'anti-commies' sentiment in the divided nation. 'Financial compensation is not a fundamental solution to soothe their sorrows. Even among the victims' bereaved families, they criticize each other as ¡®commies' because they don't know what exactly happened and why they were killed.'Haewon, which premiered at the Seoul Independent Film Festival in early December, documents testimonies of witnesses and bereaved families of the massacres. A witness in Incheon recalled the bombings by U.S. forces during the 1950 Incheon Landing, which is commemorated as a key battle in countering the North Koreans.'Many killings committed by U.S. forces are lesser known to the public and most of the bereaved families have not received any compensation,' Gu said. 'The most tragic massacre for me was the one on Aug. 15, 1946. As far as I know, around 2-3,000 mine workers in Hwasun, South Jeolla Province, joined a Liberation Day rally in Gwangju. Among them about 1,000 people were shot dead by U.S. forces. Since the mine was placed on a remote mountain, it was impossible to find any witnesses.'What made the filmmaker dig into the tragic history were some elderly women who he met in Masan, South Gyeongsang Province, in 2004. 'I heard that some bones were found in a village and I assumed they were ancient relics. I was extremely shocked that I had never heard of such massacres during my whole school days.'To keep his promise to create a film to 'comfort their souls,' Gu released Red Tomb. Sometimes he was frustrated by some the victims' families, who questioned 'How can your film change our trauma?' Red Tomb failed as far as commercial success goes, but almost 120,000 people have watched it since Gu released it for free on YouTube. Documenting the victims' testimonies is getting more urgent as time goes on. Memories of the witnesses that he met when filming Red Tomb are fading away and most of them have died. This time, he is dreaming of overseas screenings, which is why the movie has full English subtitles. He is now seeking theaters where he can screen the film. 'The victims were not killed because of their ideology. Those who were obsessed with ideology took innocent people's lives,' Gu said. 'The buried bones are not guilty. We are all obliged to heal the long-standing resentment. No ideological controversy is needed in this task.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DEATH & DYING (90%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); FILM DIRECTORS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); KOREAN WAR (89%); WITNESSES (86%); MOVIE FILMING (78%); HISTORY (77%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (73%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (73%); VISUAL ARTISTS (73%); FILM FESTIVALS (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (72%); SHOOTINGS (72%); BOMBINGS (72%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%); MINE WORKERS (60%); MINES & MINING (60%); SENIOR CITIZENS (50%)CITY: INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (73%); KWANGJU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%)LOAD-DATE: December 21, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The technique was developed by Jonathan Fox from the U.S. and Jo Salas of New Zealand and is based on the traditions and rituals of storytelling but follows the development of contemporary theater.'Playback is used by both artists and educators to address social and/or educational themes such as poverty, privilege, prejudice and bullying. The fact that the process of creating theater with others and in the presence of others means it is an inspiring and transformative experience for both performers and audience,' Neves said.Neves is a dancer, physical theater artist, choreographer and director who has taught physical theater, dance, contact improvisation, choreography composition and playback theater around the globe in places such as Brazil, Turkey, Lebanon and Switzerland.He began his career with the Contemporary Ballet of Rio de Janeiro and continued as a physical performer with the Mid-America Dance Theatre.After being inspired by the Tanztheater, Neves moved to Germany nearly 20 years ago and began performing with the Bonn Opera House. He has performed in 'Off the Map' by Zen in the Basement Dance Company and in a modern version of 'Les Noces' with French company Homnibus.The workshop is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and costs 150,000 won that includes lunch and snacks.To register, email donna.youngblood@seoulforeign.org or find the event page on facebook.com/SeoulForeignSchoolTheatre.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: THEATER & DRAMA (92%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (92%); THEATER & DRAMA EDUCATION (92%); THEATER (91%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); DANCE (90%); DANCERS (89%); DANCE COMPANIES (89%); CHOREOGRAPHY (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (78%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (78%); THEATER COMPANIES (78%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (77%); BALLET (77%)CITY: RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL (58%)COUNTRY: TURKEY (88%); NEW ZEALAND (78%); BRAZIL (58%); GERMANY (51%); FRANCE (50%)LOAD-DATE: September 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

"131","[Herald Interview] â€˜The hands that raised candles should now hold booksâ€™",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Herald Interview] â€˜The hands that raised candles should now hold booksâ€™   THE KOREA HERALD September 22, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 22, 2017 Friday[Herald Interview] â€˜The hands that raised candles should now hold booksâ€™ LENGTH: 1103 words[Eye] Located smack in the middle of downtown Seoul, Sunhwadongcheon is an oasis offering respite from the hustle and bustle of life in a megalopolis.Finding it is not easy -- it is situated in a residential apartment complex and there are no easily discernable signs pointing to it. But once inside, you will appreciate the quiet of the book cafe, William Morris prints on display at the gallery space as well as the bookstore selling Hangilsa Publishing's publications from over the years.It also aims to be a space for public discourse. 'We are currently holding a lecture series on Hannah Arendt, one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century,' said Kim Eoun-ho, president of Hangilsa Publishing, during an interview with The Korea Herald on Sept. 8 at the recently opened cultural space in Sunhwa-dong, Seoul.'She is a theorist who dealt with justice. She also explored the banality of evil,ï'said Kim in explaining the choice of the German-born American philosopher for Sunhwadongcheon's first humanities lecture series. The subject seemed to be an apt one for Korean society at the moment, he said.Kim is a former Donga Ilbo reporter who was one of some 100 reporters fired by the daily, bowing to pressure from the authoritarian Park Chung-hee regime in 1974. He founded Hangilsa in 1976. He may have started out not knowing much about bookmaking, as he professes, but over the years, Hangilsa Publishing has become one of the most prominent publishing houses in Korea, and Kim is a leading figure in the industry.Four decades in publishingIn his more than 40 years in publishing, he has published numerous bestsellers and steady sellers, including Cho chung-rae's epic 'Taebaek Sanmaekï'and the Great Books Series of humanities and classics. He also formed lasting relationships with some of the most influential figures of the times. 'I met Ham Seok-heon every day for ten years,ï'he recalls. The late Ham was a prominent writer and human rights activist who was critical of Korea's authoritarian regimes. Another figure he remembers with great respect is the late Rhee Young-hee, a journalist and writer. 'He is a leading figure in the intellectual history of this country and one of our authors,ï'he says. Another figure he kept in close contact with was the German-based composer Yun I-sang, who was kidnapped to Seoul and imprisoned on charges of spying for the North. Although he was eventually released, he was never allowed to return to Korea. Kim published 'Conversations with Yun I-sangï'in 1988.'Publishing is about giving form to the zeitgeist. It is tiring work, but always a joyous one, much like a celebration,ï'he says. This year, Hangilsa plans to publish a total of 40 titles. 'Publishing too many will be burdensome,ï'he says, pointing out that the publishing industry is in a crisis.'People are just unable to 'digestï'books anymore. They prefer something small, shallow and light,ï'he says. Even best-sellers are hard to sell and the lifecycle of books is getting ever shorter.Smartphones, which people today seem to be permanently attached to, are dumbing down people, according to Kim. 'It is impossible to engage in deep reflection. Ninety percent of the information that is floating about in cyberspace is unnecessary,ï'he says, his voice rising. 'Smartphones are like fast food.''Mind you, the crisis in publishing is not brought about by e-books,ï'he says, adding that even e-books are not doing well. 'People who don't read paper books will not read e-books either,ï'he says.Pointing out people's obsession with health and well-being today, he says, 'There should be a balance of physical health and mental health. They are not two different things.ï'His prescription is to read books to cultivate the mind. Kim likens his roles as the head of Hangilsa Publishing, chairman of Bookcity Culture Foundation and chairman of Paju Book Sori International Book Festival to that of a preacher of a book movement. 'Without books, there can be no debates. Without debates, democracy, creative society and ethical society are not possible,ï'he says. Warning that we ignore reading at our own peril, he says with a sense of urgency and gravity, 'If we continue to not read books, the country will eventually fail.'Neighborhood bookstoresSmall neighborhood bookstores have been on the rise in the last couple of years. On a recent visit to Seochon, a hanok conservation neighborhood, which has attracted small restaurants, cafes, workshops and select shops, a number of tiny bookstores stood out. One tiny basement floor bookstore had a sign outside announcing its book of the month: It only sells one title each month. At yet another small bookstore with a few tables was a notice for book reading groups. Anyone was welcome to join beginner, intermediate, or advanced groups with a beginner described as someone who does not read.Kim views this nascent rise of small neighborhood bookstores as holding the key to the resurrection of the publishing industry. 'They are they tiny blood vessels that can revive the publishing culture,ï'he says. In fact, he has suggested a movement to open 1,000 small bookstores in the city to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.It is said that parents who read to their children instill in them a lifetime habit of reading. Kim's belief that youngsters must touch and open books and read out loud led to the opening of Bookcity Culture Foundation's Forest of Wisdom, a large study in Paju open to the public.Kim envisioned the place as an intellectual, cultural playground. He would be happy to know that Forest of Wisdom is packed with kids on the weekends reading out loud and turning illustrated pages with squeals of delight. Forest of Wisdom is also a way to preserve and make use of resources that may otherwise go to waste. It has books shelves dedicated to books donated by prominent scholars and writers that could not find space in libraries.Returning to the subject of reading, Kim says, 'The hands that held candles should now hold books,ï'referring to monthslong candlelight protests that resulted in the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye and paved the way for the peaceful change of government through election.'Only by studying and reading can you set the country and society right,ï'he says.

"132","Global warming in classroom '",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"June","Global warming in classroom '  Korea Times June 26, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesJune 26, 2017 MondayGlobal warming in classroom 'LENGTH: 423 wordsThere is a bubbling controversy about how to teach ""manmade global warming"" in the classroom. Is it a scientific certainty about which there can be no dispute? Or is it a theory about which people with differing viewpoints can have a legitimate debate?Let's check in and see how The Associated Press reports on the issue: ""The struggle over what American students learn about global warming is heating up as conservative lawmakers, climate change doubters and others attempt to push rejected or debunked theories into the classroom.""Wow. Not much doubt about where the AP stands. You toe the line on ""scientific consensus"" or you're one of those awful conservative doubters trying to push rejected bunk into the classroom.Of course it's nowhere near that simple.Schools are on firm footing with the majority of their teachings because they deal either with events that have happened or are happening (history, current events) or facts that have stood the tests of time and rigorous inquiry (mathematical formulas, geographical contours, scientific forces). These things can be imparted with certainty.At the other end of the spectrum are those things about which there are as many opinions as there are human beings, including the ""social studies"" of sociology, psychology and politics. These need to be passed along with an understanding of human frailties and uncertainties.Manmade global warming - or, to use the currently favored term, ""anthropogenic climate change"" - falls somewhere between those two extremes. There is a consensus that warming exists and that humankind contributes to it. But what percentage is the human contribution? What will the effects exactly be? What should be done?The answers to the questions aren't clear, but - and here's the big problem - politicians and, now, educators, think the solution is obvious: Dramatic intervention by a powerful state that mandates drastic action from everybody. That's not science. That's politics in the extreme.Alas, some states' solutions are less than ideal.

THE KOREA HERALD December 4, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 4, 2017 Monday[Kim Seong-kon] How would young people know? LENGTH: 847 wordsRecently, while browsing the internet, I came across a review of my recent book, 'The First Time I Ever Saw a Film.' The reviewer wrote, 'Kim's interpretations of Hollywood movies are often better that the films themselves.' Then the reviewer added, 'But he seems to be trying to enlighten us that film is an excellent cultural text, which we already know quite well.'The reviewer, presumably young, obviously did not know that the book was a revised and enlarged edition of 'Essays on Film' which had been originally published in the early 1990s, at a time when few Koreans knew films could be fine cultural texts. At the time, films were dismissed as cheap, commercial entertainment at best, not only by academia but also by the general public in Korea. When my book appeared in 1994, after being serialized in a literary magazine for two years from 1991 to1993, it was warmly received by the press, which regarded the book as a breakthrough work in Korea, the first of its kind in the field of cultural studies that embraced film in literary study. Unfortunately, my book on reading culture in film was left out in the cold in academia. It was bombarded by criticism from older, conservative scholars of literature who thought of film as far more inferior than literature.In a bar, older professors gossiped, 'How could a professor of literature write on such cheap stuff as film?ï'Alas! Koreans were and still are incredibly slow learners and so are scholars of the humanities. As a result, they have always been left behind, unable to catch up with rapid social change taking place in the world. Therefore, not only did my book not receive any recognition from academia, but it also had to endure hostility from those who firmly believed that taking films seriously was out of the question. Today, however, things have changed. Hundreds of books on film have been published and it has become fashionable to read culture in film. Young people are infatuated with movies, and professors of literature, language and history frequently use film texts in class in the College of Humanities. It is only natural that you use film texts in the age of electronic and audio-visual media. But how would the young reviewer know that the book was born under such circumstances? How would the reviewer know that the book had gone through such ordeals? Many literary historians pointed out that the book was the first attempt to read culture in film. Not knowing the background, the young reviewer seemed puzzled and even annoyed by the author's assertion that we should read culture in film. Obviously, it has never occurred to the reviewer that the present reality in which he or she lives is radically different from the past. In the movie 'The Rock,ï'Gen. Francis Hummel reproaches young Hayden Sinclair, chief of staff at the White House, for his ignorance of history and the ordeals that his father's generation went through. Perhaps the younger generation would hate to hear it, but they should know that what they are enjoying now came from someone fighting or sacrificing for them in the past. But how would they know? Likewise, how would young Koreans know about the Japanese occupation or the tragic division of their country? How could they know about the atrocities of the Korean War or the terror of communism? How would they know why US troops are deployed in South Korea? And how would they know about the cruelty of the military dictatorship? Ignorant of history, young Koreans, with their smartphones and laptops, assume that they have been living in a society that was affluent from the beginning.At the end of 'Mockingjay,ï'the final book of the 'The Hunger Gamesï'trilogy, Katniss Everdeen watches her two children play outside their house. She says, 'Our children, who don't know they play on a graveyard.ï'Indeed, so many people have sacrificed themselves to give their children a better society. Yet, children would not know that they are playing on the graveyard of those who died for them. They think the world has always been peaceful and comfortable. How would they know there were the deadly hunger games that their parents had to go through? Peeta comforts Katniss, saying, 'It will be okay. We have each other.ï'Indeed, older people have only one another. The younger generation would never understand them or give them credit for the ordeals they went through to give their children a better world. In today's Korean society, the gap between the younger generation and the older generation is getting deeper and wider. Perhaps the older generation has to sadly realize that they have to fade away, silently crying out, 'I am legend!ï'in despair, just like the protagonist of Richard Matheson's novel of the same title.

They say taking part in compiling private publishers' history textbooks will essentially be the same as participating in the state-authored textbook scheme.In 2015 the Park Geun-hye administration drew up plans to introduce a single state-authored textbook system beginning this year, over the existing system of allowing textbooks from multiple publishers.The plan met with protests, as liberal historians accused the conservative government of attempting to distort history in its favor.But amid the controversy, the government drew up a pool of authors and last November unveiled the first draft of the state-authored textbook.The eruption of the massive influence-peddling scandal involving President Park and her confidant Choi Soon-sil last year only fueled greater opposition to the Park administration and its policies. The government announced earlier this month it would officially allow schools to use both state-authored and private publishers' textbooks starting next year, instead of schools adopting only the state-authored textbook from March as planned.In the meantime, the government said schools could volunteer to use the textbook under a pilot project, along with private publishers' books.Among the issues of contention is whether Aug. 15, 1948 - three years after Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 occupation - should be recognized as the day of the Korean government's establishment or as the foundation of the nation. The state-authored textbook backs the latter claim.Progressive historians claim this view downplays the significance of independence movements that took place under the occupation, as well as the establishment of the provisional government in Shanghai in 1919.The state-authored textbook is also accused of glorifying the economic growth achieved under the rule of former President Park Chung-hee, the father of the incumbent President, while downplaying the human rights violations that took place under his dictatorship.Meanwhile, growing voices have been calling for the use of the state-authored textbooks to be scrapped.Opposition lawmakers are attempting to pass a bill that will ban the government from holding the authority to publish textbooks.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (97%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (92%); BOYCOTTS (90%); HISTORY (90%); PUBLISHING (90%); CONSERVATISM (90%); WRITERS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (78%); LIBERALISM (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (75%); SCANDALS (68%); DICTATORSHIPS (63%); SEPARATISM & SECESSION (63%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (60%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SHANGHAI, CHINA (51%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); CHINA (79%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Abe's slogan for a normal Japan, in his words, means an amnesiac Japan that stops apologizing for atrocities against its neighbors.Tokyo is betting heavily on the 'self-resolution' of the issue of comfort women, now in their 80s and 90s and in frail health, through a waiting game. This year alone, six former comfort women have died, leaving only 34 survivors.About 200,000, mostly Korean girls and women, were commandeered across the Korean Peninsula, which was under Japanese occupation and was plundered for Japan's war effort. A lot of these women lived their lives in shame, hiding their identities and not returning to their families.Japan is systematically trying to dilute its criminality by disseminating falsehoods that most comfort women had volunteered to be prostitutes for imperial soldiers in frontline brothels.Above all, it is nothing short of utter absurdity to imagine imperial Japan respected human rights and freedom of expression and conducted its main war support program using volunteers.Even more unimaginable is Japan's claim that these girls and women consciously decided to serve 100 to 200 soldiers per day, turning themselves into a human cesspool.With its latest decision not to recognize the evidential materials for Japan's misdeeds, UNESCO is turning a blind eye to what should be judged as a crime against humanity on a colossal scale and is raising suspicions that the U.N. body is conspiring to bury the war crimes for which Japan was responsible.UNESCO's rejection of the request is contrary to the U.N.'s basic spirit of conscience and protection. UNESCO has denied a significant part of its raison d'etre and given its members one more reason not to stay.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); WAR CRIMES (89%); WORLD WAR II (78%); SLAVERY (78%); CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (77%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (76%); AGREEMENTS (76%); WAR & CONFLICT (74%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (73%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (72%); HUMAN RIGHTS (68%); PROSTITUTION (64%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (63%); FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (63%); PRIME MINISTERS (55%)PERSON: SHINZO ABE (79%)CITY: TOKYO, JAPAN (58%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (99%); CHINA (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: November 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

'  Korea Times November 27, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesNovember 27, 2017 MondayWhy do Korean nurses in Germany not return home? 'LENGTH: 619 wordsA documentary play ""The Nurses, Who Do Not Return Home"" centers on Korean nurses who migrated to Germany in the 1960s. / Courtesy of Seoul Arts CenterPlay based on history features German actorsBy Kwon Mee-yooIn the 1960s, many Korean nurses and mine workers migrated to Germany, as the country invited Korean laborers as part of its Gastarbeiter program. Images usually depict the dispatched nurses to Germany wearing ""hanbok"" (traditional Korean costume) and waving Korean Taegeukgi flags at the airport. They are just lumped together as a symbol of sacrifice for economic development.A documentary play ""The Nurses, Who Do Not Return Home"" sheds light on the other half of the history of these Korean-German nurses, centering on individual lives rather than the whole history.The documentary play is a product of director Kim Jae-yeop's year in Berlin. He met politics expert Yoo Jung-sook who studied the lives of Korean immigrants and nurses in Germany.Director Kim, who also is a professor of Sejong University's Department of Film Art, headed to Berlin for a year as an exchange professor at Berlin University of the Arts. A year at the German capital made the director ponder ideas of cosmopolitanism, immigration and refugees.He presented ""Die Gedanken Sind Frei,"" or ""Thoughts are Free"" at the Doosan Art Center in May, which was more about the artist's role in this cosmopolitan world as a first of his 'Berlin Commentary' trilogy.A scene from the play ""The Nurses, Who Do Not Return Home"" / Courtesy of Seoul Arts Center""Die Krankenschwestern, die nicht nach Hause zuruckkehren,"" or ""The Nurses, Who Do Not Return Home,"" is the second in the series and currently staged at the Jayu Theater of the Seoul Arts Center in Seoul. This time, Kim narrowed the subject down to a specific group of Koreans living in Germany - Korean nurses who went to West Germany in the 1960s.The play revolves around three Korean nurses - Sun-ok, Guk-hui and Myeong-ja - who head to Germany for different reasons. They encounter Korean student Jeong-min, who studies politics in Germany. All the characters are based on real people.Jeong-min, who researches the history of immigrants, decides to focus on the individuals' lives for her doctoral thesis and the four become friends, even though their paths might never have crossed in Korea.They watch Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1974 film ""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,"" which revolves around the relationship between an elderly woman and a Moroccan migrant worker in post-war Germany. The portrayal of minorities in the film resonates with them and they begin to speak their voices on social issues.They form an association of Korean women in Germany and start to fight for their rights. They gather signatures in a nationwide campaign to acquire the right to stay in Germany and bring up the unfair treatment of female migrants in Germany.Though their foundation of living has shifted to Germany, they never forgot Korea and made known the circumstances of the May 18 Gwangju Uprising in 1980 after watching German journalist Jurgen Hinzpeter's video.They grow up through solidarity and director Kim tells the tale of these girls becoming cosmopolites who can raise their voice in a composed tone, through his alter ego Jae-yeop in the play, acted by Jung Won-jo.Jeon Guk-hyang plays Myeong-ja, Lee Young-suk plays Sun-ok and Hong Sung-kyung plays Guk-hui.Two German-born actors add diversity to the play. Anna Rihlmann, also known as Anna Yoon, and Philipp Windischmann play multiple German characters and make the audiences think about Korean society, which still has strong racial homogeneity.The play runs until Dec. 3.

""I told him, let's make a fun movie and he said he was confident.""ã  The actress had wrapped up two lengthy projects at the time -- ""Julia"" (2008) and ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (2011).

He eventually rises as a guide to passengers in their rebellion, a figure who does not yield to authority but rejects the system altogether.Hong Sang-soo, Jung Jae-young and Isabelle HuppertBefore director Hong's much-publicized affair with the actress Kim, he had long been known for inserting his alter ego into his nonchalantly realistic films, represented by actors such as Kim Tae-woo, Yoo Joon-sang and Kim Sang-kyung.But the best embodiment of Hong's trademark character, the hypocritical artist who is often chauvinistic, vain but hopelessly self-unaware is perhaps actor Jung Jae-young, who starred in ""Our Sunhi"" (2013), ""Right Now, Wrong Then"" (2015), ""On the Beach at Night Alone"" (2017) and ""Clair's Camera"" (2017).""I don't think I acted out a character. I tried my best not to act,"" Jung said in a 2015 interview for ""Right Now, Wrong Then,"" in which he portrays a married film director clumsily making advances at a timid painter, played by Kim Min-hee.The French actress Isabelle Huppert has also worked with director Hong multiple times, first in the 2012 comedy-drama ""In Another Country,"" and most recently in ""Clair's Camera,"" which was invited to compete at Cannes this year.A still of the film ""In Another Country,"" depicting Isabelle Huppert (Jeonwonsa Films)In the 2012 film, Huppert plays three different versions of the ""charming French visitor"" -- a famous filmmaker, the wife of a rich French executive, and a divorced housewife -- as the film traces how her hosts' behavior and conversations shift subtly according to her different statuses.""Through these three little stories we see a woman's whole emotional life -- desire, expectation, loneliness, love, disappointment,"" Huppert said to The Guardian in a 2012 interview at Cannes. ""(Hong) writes his dialogue every night and gives you the script every morning, and you shoot it. The film looks spontaneous but it's very precise actually.""Kim Jee-woon & Lee Byung-hunDirector Kim Jee-woon rose to acclaim through his highly stylized, elegant depictions of bleak lives. Actor Lee Byung-hun is a central figure in his filmography, the core of the director's calculated cinematography.The 2005 mobster noir ""A Bittersweet Life"" still remains one of Kim and Lee's representative works to this day. Lee plays Seon-woo, a loyal and perfectionist gangster whose life spirals out of control when he is ordered to carry out the dangerous task of spying on his boss' girlfriend, and acts on an emotional impulse.A still of the film ""A Bittersweet Life,"" depicting Lee Byung-hun (CJ Entertainment)In Kim's Korean-style Western adventure ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" (2008), an homage to Clint Eastwood's ""The Good, the Bad, the Ugly"" and set against the backdrop of 1930s Manchuria, Lee plays ""the bad"" gang leader Park Chang-yi. The character is ruthless in his single-minded pursuit of treasure depicted on a mysterious map, the dark counterpart of ""the weird"" train robber played by Song Kang-ho and ""the good"" bounty hunter played by Jung Woo-sung.The role brought Lee critical and popular acclaim, imprinting him in viewers' minds as a villain of all-consuming force. Lee called Kim an ""intense director"" in a 2009 interview. ""You can tell from his films. How can you create such scenes if you are not intense?E J Yong & Youn Yuh-jungDirector E J Yong's muse and persona seem to be the veteran actress Youn Yuh-jung, who starred in ""Actresses"" (2009), an experimental documentary-style film tracing behind-the-scenes gossip among female performers.A still of the film ""Actresses,"" depicting Youn Yuh-jung (Showbox)E is known for spotlighting the often irrational emotional battles between his sensitive characters. Youn plays a version of herself, a 60-something actress who feels awkward at a fashion shoot.She teams up with E again in ""The Bacchus Lady"" (2016) in which Youn portrays an aged sex worker who ends up offering much more than sexual services to her elderly clientele. Youn won best actress for her performance in the film at Montreal's Fantasia International Film Festival.""It's not a commercial film. But I was happy I could take on a role that fits my age,"" Youn said in an interview last year. While the filming process was ""unbelievably hard,"" Youn said she took on the project due to her faith in E.

"142","Gyeonggi Province rebrands English Village to Change Up Campus",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"October","Gyeonggi Province rebrands English Village to Change Up Campus   THE KOREA HERALD October 17, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 17, 2017 TuesdayGyeonggi Province rebrands English Village to Change Up Campus LENGTH: 669 wordsGyeonggi English Village, which was South Korea's first residential English camp, has rebranded itself as Change Up Campus as part of efforts to nurture and promote high-quality and future-oriented education for students, according to the province Tuesday. The Change Up Campus run by Gyeonggi Province will provide programs designed to help students to better prepare for the coming 'fourth industrial revolution' on top of learning the English language, the province said. Marking the reopening, a forum was organized Tuesday by the province and the Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, where five experts on a panel exchanged views on what kind of education Change Up Campus should strive to offer. Professor Shin Kwan-soo of Namseoul University, who obtained a Ph.D. in international education from the University of Southern California, said programs should be based on 'creativity, collaboration, communication and critical thinking' in line with global educational standards. Creativity in education has often been associated with arts education, he went on, but it could be expanded to teaching students how to think creatively in various fields, he said. 'A great many business leaders think they were not born more creative than others, but were educated to be so,ï'he said, citing a study published in Harvard Business Review. Another participant, Chang Jae-young, president of Royal Academy of Music Korea, cited the UK's art education where students must master at least one musical instrument until high school, as a successful model of teaching that needs to be adopted at the Change Up Campus. 'The UK and other developed countries in Europe emphasize the importance of art education since preschool,ï'Chang said. 'Here, we do have an art class in public schools, but it is rather treated separately among other subjects. But in the UK, arts instruction is integrated into math, science, foreign language and other subjects, allowing students to learn it in the context of everyday life,ï'Chang said. 'By doing so, creativity can thrive,ï'Chang added. With the launch of the new educational hub, the province should work in partnership with local communities and educational experts for the development of its programs, said Gyeonggi Province councilor Bae Soo-moon.The councilor said that the campus could provide classes run by apprentice teachers from the region's education colleges through partnership.'It's a win-win for everyone. With the partnership, the province can resolve the possible problem of insufficient supply of native English-speaking teachers, while apprentice teachers can effectively develop their teaching skills,ï'Bae said. Seoul National University of Education professor Hong Sun-ho, however, emphasized that the province should learn from its own experiences of running the English village business and prepare for more high-quality education options. 'We need to think about what to learn from the previous business model and what to work on to improve it. We need not only high-quality educational programs for students, but for teachers as well to run the programs more smoothly,ï'Hong said. 'Having good software is as important as having good hardware as part of the overall package,ï'Hong added.At an opening ceremony held two days earlier in Paju, Gyeonggi Province Gov. Nam Kyung-pil said that the remodeled campus 'carries the values of evolution and revolutionï'to provide a better learning opportunity to the next generations, and that it would 'provide a model for the country's new education.ï'The new campus provides classes for students including experimenting with drones, robotics, coding and 3-D printing, as well as language courses and mentoring, as part of a solution to help them learn arts, science and technology out of public schools, according to the province.By Bak Se-hwan (sh@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (89%); APPRENTICESHIPS & INTERNSHIPS (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (77%); ACADEMIC STANDARDS (72%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (72%); CONTINUING EDUCATION (72%); MUSIC (65%); MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS (65%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (56%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (71%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); ENGLAND (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (86%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (71%)LOAD-DATE: October 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"143","Nuclear plants strong or vulnerable?",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"July","Nuclear plants strong or vulnerable?  Korea Times July 12, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesJuly 12, 2017 WednesdayNuclear plants strong or vulnerable?BYLINE: By Ko Dong-hwanLENGTH: 1854 wordsThe Kori 1 nuclear reactor at sea shores in Busan / Korea Times file Experts differ on safety, but agree on Korea's need for a balanced energy mixNuclear energy experts are at loggerheads over whether nuclear plants in Korea are safe. Pro-nuclear experts believe the plants can withstand seismic activity (earthquakes) at almost all levels.But others argue that the structures do not stand a chance against natural catastrophes.The disagreement comes amid growing concern about nuclear power after Moon Jae-in administration announced in June that its eco-friendly energy policies included scrapping nuclear reactors.The Kori 1 nuclear reactor, Korea's first commercial type completed in 1978 in Busan, was permanently closed on June 18 due to safety issues.In less than two weeks, construction work on Shin Kori reactors 5 and 6 in Ulsan was halted indefinitely.An anti-nuclear civic group of 100 professors endorsed Moon's energy policies in a public announcement.But Korean nuclear researchers and 27 global environmentalists, including America's Michael Shellenberger - dubbed 'hero of the environment' by Time magazine - urged the President to reconsider the policies, saying nuclear energy was an essential for the future.'When the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred in 2011, power plants in the area that were unaffected by the tsunami worked fine,' said Korean Institute of Energy Research former president Whang Joo-ho.'Japanese reactors in the western regions or near Kobe have all fended off quakes. The structures, designed to withstand earthquakes with a magnitude of up to 6.5, have in fact handled magnitude 7 to 8.'If the reactors are strictly kept to their optimal status, they can withstand the tremors.'At the time of the Fukushima disaster, people in Onagawa, 180 kilometers north, evacuated to the city's nuclear plant, where they stayed safely for three months.The reactor was built on high ground as protection against a tsunami. A 13-meter sea wall also protects the plant.Whang, who is also vice president of Kyung Hee University's Global Campus, used this example to highlight that natural disasters do not pose direct threats to the plants.But Prof. Kim Ik-jung, former commissioner of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission anti-nuclear civic group, dismissed Whang's opinions.'It is laughable to hear that the Fukushima disaster could have been avoided if the damaged reactors were built stronger to withstand earthquakes better,' said Kim, who teaches at Dongguk Univesity's Medical School at the Gyeongju Campus.'One of the components ensuring a nuclear plant's safety is earthquake-proof design.'The Fukushima disaster clearly proved that such safety is unachievable in the face of natural disasters.'Dr. Park Jin-hee from Dongguk University's Seoul Campus said the strongest earthquake possible in Korea was magnitude 7.5 and that, according to the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, the technology to withstand an earthquake of such strength did not exist in Korea.'Disasters like Fukushima will only occur rarely. And do we need to prepare for that by investing billions of won? No,' said Park, who, with Kim and two other professors, represent the professors' group founded in 2011.'President Moon officially ordered Korean nuclear plants to be designed to withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 7,' he said. 'But no one knows what will happen in the future. One thing is certain. Once the reactors fall before Mother Nature, they are beyond recovery.'Whang Joo-ho, former president of Korean Institute of Energy ResearchPark Jin-hee, Dharma College Professor from Dongguk University's Seoul CampusKim Ik-jung, former commissioner of the Nuclear Safety and Security CommissionExperts also disagreed on managing waste from Korea's nuclear plants.While about 450 nuclear reactors have been erected across the world as of November 2016 - with almost 100 in the U.S. and more than 50 in France - technology to build storage areas for spent nuclear fuel, especially high-level radioactive waste largely made of uranium, plutonium and curium, is still being developed worldwide.'There are about 16,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste in Korea,' Kim said. 'They must be safely sealed shut in storage for at least 100,000 years. But the nation neither has such storage nor can it build something like that.'The sooner the nation gives up nuclear energy, the less waste problems there will be.'But Whang pointed out that suitable storage areas were being built in Finland and Sweden, while the search for storage sites in the U.S. that was halted eight years ago for 'political reasons' resumed.'It normally takes 20 to 30 years to search for and find a site and build the storage area,' Whang said.'In Korea, a proposal about storage site designation was submitted to the National Assembly but it hasn't been passed. And we haven't begun searching for the site either. It must be done fast.'There were also different interpretations of whether there would be enough electricity reserves without nuclear energy.Korea has had plenty of electricity reserves since 2014 and, although the number of nuclear plants was to decrease, there will be enough power until 2030 thanks to increasing renewable energy-based reactors, according to Park.'In 2015, Koreans had enough electricity available even when six out of 10 power plants did not run, meaning electricity reserves were stable at 60 percent,' said Park.'Every two years the country calculates how much electricity to save for emergency use. In its seventh plan in 2014, the government expected electricity demand to rise by 2.2 percent but it rose only 0.6 percent.'In previous plan the figure was set at 3.2 percent but the actual number was well below this. The same happened in 2015.'At this pace, the reserve rate will fall to 15 percent by 2030, which means there will still be an electricity surplus.'But Whang said Korea could not depend solely on renewable energy because their power sources could be inconsistent and unreliable.'In March 2016, a solar eclipse in Germany lasted 90 minutes and disabled photovoltaic plants,' Whang said. 'It cost an amount of electricity that could have been provided by six nuclear plants. Germany prepared for that moment six months earlier, importing electricity and saving it from other energy plants like fossil fuel.'While the country exports electricity, it also imports it because it does not depend solely on renewable energy. It imports an amount equivalent to one-tenth of the electricity that Korea produces.'Korea, a peninsula nation blocked by the inter-Korean border and detached from other countries, has nowhere to import electricity from, meaning it must be self-reliant.Whang believes that if the country relies on renewable energy with the risks of prolonged monsoon periods without sun, or windless days, possible damage would eventually dissipate electricity reserves.President Moon Jae-in joined a ceremony for permanent shutdown of the Kori 1 nuclear reactor on June 19. / Korea Times fileRenewable energyKorea will need nuclear energy for decades until it finds a replacement. To meet electricity demand and maintain stable output without polluting the environment with toxic waste or slapping consumers with expensive electricity bills, energy resources' diversity, from fossil fuels to wind, must be balanced.Pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear experts share the goal of the so-called 'energy mix.''If the lifespan of currently operative nuclear plants does not get extended, they will all expire by 2045, except Shin Kori 3 and 4, which were extended last year to operate until 2075,' Park said.She added that the government's national energy portfolio by 2030 would reduce fossil fuel use to 10 percent of overall energy resources, raise natural gas to 40 percent, reduce nuclear to 18-20 percent and raise renewable energy to 20 percent.And because Korea lacks energy resources - like abundant timberlands in Canada or deep oil wells in the Middle East - Korea cannot afford to lose nuclear energy now. In March, nuclear energy provided 28 percent of national electricity output.'Unless we want to become energy poor, we cannot easily give up nuclear energy,' Whang said. 'We have thrived in the peaceful era of energy since the mid-1980s and avoided the global oil shock in the early 2000s because of our stable energy mix.'Even fossil fuel that emits air pollutants is necessary to save humanity from an energy imbalance.'Renewable energy is getting cheaper and creating more electricity than before. The global renewable energy market in 2016 produced 152 gigawatts, up 14 percent from the previous year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.Following the Paris climate accord in 2015, demand for renewable energy was spread from advanced countries to developing nations, expanding the renewable energy market.Including biomass, renewable energy now produces more than 19 percent of global electricity.And because of competition for photovoltaic and wind power - together accounting for 77 percent of newly built renewable energy-based power facilities in 2015 - the cost of building renewable energy-based power plants is falling drastically. Invested capital in global renewable energy fell from $348 billion in 2015 to an estimated $287 billion next year.'In the 1970s, the solar power rate was 500 won ($0.43) per kilowatt hour while nuclear energy was 60 won,' Park said. 'Solar now is 120 won and is expected to match that of nuclear by 2020.'With the global trend of rising renewable energies, photovoltaic's market rate will naturally become cheaper than that of coal without government subsidies, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.'The main control room of the Kori 1 nuclear reactor / Korea Times fileThe biggest concern behind nuclear plants' demise in Korea is expensive electricity. But anti nuclear experts say the increase would be almost negligible for most households and that this could be dealt with through government policies.'Simulation showed us that the rate hike because of the absence of nuclear power will reach 30 percent in 20 years, which is similar to what happens during inflation,' Kim said.'Besides, industrial electricity in Korea has been available at a cheaper rate.'It is a deficit for Korea Electric Power Corporation (Korea's largest electric utility) and carries off citizens' tax. It's about time to end this aberration.'Korea's renewable portfolio standard (RPS) - a regulation that has required increased production of electricity from renewable energy sources since 2012 - has annually increased renewable energy-based electricity output by 0.5 percent until 2014.The policy replaced the feed-in tariff, a policy designed to accelerate investment in renewable energy technologies, in 2012.'Moon's administration aims to bring Korea's renewable energies' output up to 20 percent under RPS, while capacity will naturally grow to 13 percent under current policy,' Park said.'If the government introduces more-rigorous policies friendly to renewable energies, I believe Moon's goal can be achieved.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (92%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (90%); NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); EARTHQUAKES (89%); MARCH 2011 JAPAN NUCLEAR DISASTER (89%); TSUNAMIS (89%); NATURAL DISASTERS (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (88%); NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY (78%); ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT (77%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (77%); ENERGY RESEARCH (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (75%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (74%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); CLOSINGS (72%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (72%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)STATE: TOHOKU, JAPAN (94%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (98%); JAPAN (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: July 12, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Now the time has come for the international community to discuss measures to deal with the young dictator's unacceptable act of terrorism, considering that such an assassination is impossible without an order from the highest leader.On Sunday, Malaysian police said five North Koreans were involved in the murder, with four of them having fled the Southeast Asian country on the day of the killing, Feb. 13. They are questioning the remaining suspect, Ri Jong-chol, who was arrested in Kuala Lumpur, Saturday. Three more North Koreans are also wanted for questioning.All of this bolsters the fact that the repressive communist country has orchestrated the suspected contract killing _ two women with Vietnamese and Indonesian passports joined forces to spay a toxic liquid on Kim Jong-nam. Pyongyang tried to cover up its involvement in the assassination by hiring foreigners, but to no avail.Chairing a National Security Council meeting Monday, Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn reaffirmed the North's involvement, calling the assassination an 'unacceptable inhuman criminal act.' 'This clearly demonstrates the reckless and brutal nature of the North Korean regime,' he said.If it is conclusively determined that the isolated regime in Pyongyang planned and directed the killing, the international community should do whatever it can to punish Kim Jong-un and all others concerned. Specifically, it might be necessary for the United Nations to ask the International Criminal Court to prosecute Kim Jong-un for crimes against humanity.Kim is already notorious for having executed more than 100 generals and high-ranking officials, including his uncle Jang Song-taek, to strengthen his grip on power. Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are also in prison camps, living in fear of torture and mistreatment. In fact, there are ample reasons to hold him accountable.The United States should consider re-designating North Korea as a state sponsoring terrorism. America removed the North from its terrorism blacklist in 2008 after keeping it on the list for more than 20 years following its bombing of a Korean Air plane in 1987. Since the latest assassination, there have been mounting calls in the U.S. Congress for putting Pyongyang on the terrorism blacklist again.The Malaysian government should act responsibly to cope with challenges from the shocking incident. It suffered a humiliation of a foreign celebrity being poisoned to death at one of its international airports in broad daylight. Malaysia must lodge a strong protest with North Korea and demand certain measures, which could include bringing back the suspects who reportedly have returned to Pyongyang. The Southeast Asian country also might need to consider severing diplomatic ties with the North.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (90%); TERRORISM (89%); POISONINGS (78%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (78%); ARRESTS (78%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); INTERROGATION OF SUSPECTS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (77%); UNITED NATIONS (77%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); TERRORIST ATTACKS (76%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (75%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (73%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (73%); AIRPORTS (72%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (72%); NATIONAL SECURITY (71%); BOMBINGS (71%); INTERIM MANAGEMENT (67%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (66%); US CONGRESS (61%); MURDER (58%); FOREIGN LABOR (52%)ORGANIZATION: NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL (55%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (78%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA (72%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); MALAYSIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); ASIA (91%); INDONESIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: February 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"145","[Herald Interview] Why sensitivity is important in design",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"November","[Herald Interview] Why sensitivity is important in design   THE KOREA HERALD November 2, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDNovember 2, 2017 Thursday[Herald Interview] Why sensitivity is important in design LENGTH: 1493 wordsIn an age where design permeates all industries and aspects of life, this year's Herald Design Forum questions the role humanity plays in it.At the forum's second session, set to take place Tuesday at 1 p.m. at The Shilla Seoul's Dynasty Hall, three global designers will expound on their approach to design.The speakers of the session, titled 'Design Thinking,' spoke with The Korea Herald prior to the event to answer questions on the fundamental meaning of design and its lasting value. -Ed. Communicating feelings through spaces: Carme PigemWorld-renowned Spanish architect Carme Pigem is a member of architectural firm RCR Arquitectes, which won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize this year. In this edited excerpt, Pigem discusses the relationship between human beings and their environment. Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead trends in the global design industry? What role do you think design will play in the 'fourth industrial revolution'?A: I believe that the value of the product in itself has the power to lead trends. Design's role in our new world of Internet of Things should be to further emphasize the beauty beyond the utility of any tool, whether it be equipment or furniture. But tools should also understand the way daily lives have changed. Q: What is your 'driving force'? What drives you to pursue and try out new designs? A: Our driving force is to communicate feelings to people through spaces. We want to research essential meanings and be linked with the existing environment, whether it be city, landscape or building. And we strive to work hard until the answer to the question is beauty.Q: What is design that gains value over time? A: Design that is timeless. When a space or a work of art, has quality, it keeps its value through time and you can still enjoy it even if its initial functional purpose changes. Q: Architecture is greatly influenced by social issues. Some notable architects, for instance, have ties with politics or support a certain political party. Europe has recently faced growing social controversy over refugees. How do you think refugee-related issues could be alleviated using architecture?A: It is a very difficult question. It is a big problem when people must run away from their countries. When large numbers of people arrive in other countries, there are two possible ways to manage their arrival, considering their number and time constraints. The first would be to prepare a quick venue where people could stay for a short period of time, by using abandoned buildings for example. The countries could also try to absorb the new people into their existing structures. Q: When it comes to architecture, the quality of material is said to effect usersï'emotions as much as design. A: I think that is true when the new material has some kind of relation to the existing ones. Then the relation and combination established between the two make the design unique.Q: A word of advice for aspiring architects dreaming of becoming a world-renowned creator? A: You should pursue your dreams, work hard, believe in yourself, be honest with yourself and live -- and work (it's the same thing) -- with passion.Channeling the European sensitivity: Seok Yong-baeKorean designer Seok Yong-bae has worked with various global apparel brands to helm their shoe collections. In 2008, Seok served as head of design for Dolce & Gabanna's casual and sneaker collections. Now running his own studio and brand, Camotartan, Seok partners with brands including Bally, Geox and Diesel. Q: You started out as an automobile designer, then transitioned to shoe design. What kind of similarities do the two types of design share?A: I started as an automobile designer in 2001 at the Italian company Pininfarina. I had the opportunity to participate in a project with Fila Italia, as a consulting shoe designer, and that is how I came to be where I am today. The similarity between automobile and shoe design is that both are tools that serve the function of transportation, helping humans move conveniently. Shoes, like cars, go through an extensive design process. Apart from the outer appearance such as color, the technical elements such as the sole, the liner, material come together. Only when everything is aligned can the shoe give both pleasure and convenience to the consumer. I have been sought out by many companies as a consultant, and many prospective projects with European luxury brands are in the works. Q: The Italian fashion industry is known for being entirely talent- and merit-based, but also seen as closed off to foreign talent. What was your experience?A: That is true. The Italian fashion industry seems very open but it is difficult and rare for foreign designers to rise to director positions. To put it briefly, only effort and proven talent prevail. Personally, I believe I was able to overcome these difficulties because I am able to understand the Italian and European sensibility, because I am able to understand them and communicate with them regardless of ethnicity or nationality. Now, they do not regard me as a Korean or Asian designer but purely as designer Seok. Q: What kind of design is timeless?A: Design that gains value over time is a piece of work created by a designer who did not cling to the fad of the era, but created based on the designer's own philosophy or aesthetics. One example can be found in Italy's Ferrari cars. The cars strive for formative perfection, making them transcend time through beauty, and increase in price as time goes by. Q: What do you think the role of design should be in the face of the fourth industrial revolution? In product design, I believe the product's inherent function should not be lost. It should become more convenient while reflecting the era's style. Currently, design acts as a connecting chain between humanity and technology by giving birth to products that possess both functionality and beauty.Careful attention to parentsï'needs: Aernout Dijkstra-HellingaAernout Dijkstra-Hellinga is the senior lead designer and vice president of sustainability at Bugaboo, a Dutch mobility company that specializes in strollers and luggage. Dijkstra-Hellinga explains in detail the creative process behind some of the company's most renowned products such as the Bugaboo Donkey, a convertible stroller that attaches two seats together. Q: What is the most important feature of mobility? How are you blending such features to your design? A: Mobility for us means transportation of everything (your kids, stuff, etc.) from a to b. We like that our products are visible in public spaces. That's where other people see our users interact with our products. Q: Bugaboo is a leading design company in smart mobility. What is your definition of smart mobility? What is the role of design in the industry?A: We create products with smart design, meaning they are very intuitive to use, engineered to last and provide value for money. This is what we consider smart design. Q: What inspired you to design the Bugaboo Donkey stroller? Why did you feel the need to create such a design? Could you give a brief explanation of the process?A: We had a lot parents asking for a solution for two or more children. We could have easily given parents what they asked for, a dedicated duo stroller. But at Bugaboo we always like to think about the need behind the question. We figured out that people wanted a stroller that could adapt to their needs. Sometimes you want to transport a single child, sometimes even three. So we needed to come up with a stroller that you could easily change from mono to duo -- within seconds. Next to that, we felt that it was important to give both children the same space, the same interaction with their parents. Lastly, the stroller should offer easy one-handed steering, even when fully loaded. By looking at all the needs we quickly realized that the only sensible configuration was to have a side-by-side stroller. The challenge was to make it narrow enough to fit through a standard door opening, while at the same time give the children enough space in which to sit comfortably. Q: What is the 'luggage systemï'suggested by Bugaboo? How do you think it will change our daily life?A: If you walk through any airport, train or bus station, you'll see people struggling with their heavy luggage. We designed this luggage system to take away that burden and turn it into a smooth experience. It gives your arms and back a break because you can push it along with very little effort. Details make traveling more efficient -- interlocking cases which keep everything in place; an organizer for electronics can be clicked off at airport security.

That it is extremely unnatural and dangerous to drag people along by orders of a single individual or of a few is all too well proven by the misfortunes that befell Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.?? - Kim Koo (1876-1949), ??My Wish??A ??chinilpa?? (collaborationist with Imperial Japan) he wasn??t. Neither was he especially fond of the monarchy which antedated Japan??s stealthy routing of Korea, having been judged to be a member of a less-favored ??commoner?? (sangmin) class.Furthermore, he never became ppalgaengi (communist), pro-communist, ??pro-North?? (jongbuk) or fascist -- as some have snobbishly, dubiously and rather lazily claimed.What Kim Koo most certainly was, beyond being a product of harsh circumstances and an impossibly tumultuous and convoluted period: an earnest patriot who thoroughly loved Korea and its people, a tireless advocate for his nation??s ??full and complete independence,?? and a work-in-progress (hence problematic to judge).After the unscrupulous and catastrophic decision by two competing empires to divvy up the country -- scorning basic humanitarian principles and expert warnings explicitly indicating it would lead to unprecedented crises for Koreans, including war -- Kim promptly became a redoubtable voice espousing ??unification now.?? He labored until his death to avert the impending proxy war between the freshly-fractured, hastily-forming, mutually-antagonistic and ideologically-incompatible states, for which the stage was being set.A former State Department official -- regarded as one of the only US ??Korea experts?? of the period - stressed for a 1950 report, ??Since the 38-degree line was not only without any topographic basis, but also without any foundation in previous political and economic fact as well, the division amounted in reality to the vivisection of Korea.??A heartrending plea for unity published a year before Kim Koo??s ruthless assassination at the Korean age of 74, dispels libelous myths surrounding a fabricated ??true agenda?? or malevolent character. Stereotypically ignoble distortions, heedlessly jumbled into a ghastly caricature, fed a narrative or theory by careerist historians dependent upon strikingly dubious sources (typically secondhand accounts from his ??pro-Japanese?? political enemies). Wildly inaccurate depictions have been spread -- replete with an air of historiographical authority -- as ??history.?? A brutish and not-quite-human contortion of Kim Koo??s person has been incautiously recycled through a string of books on Korea.??Entreaty to My 30 Million Compatriots,?? written in 1948, may be a helpful brisk-read for those who wish to understand the man and his actual disposition - such as his straightforward hunger for peace and unity within Korea and predilection for democratic principles, also evident in other writings such as his 1947 statement of political philosophy titled ??My Wish.??In the 1948 statement, Kim Koo advised reevaluating the term ??liberation?? as applied to Aug. 15, 1945, as the era of ??freedom we had awaited instead divided our territory, ushering in the peril that the Korean Peninsula may be eternally separated into two countries.?? He endorsed instituting an alternative conception which more precisely encapsulates the meaning of Aug. 15 for Korea.Baekbeom (Kim Koo??s pen name, roughly meaning ??common person??) pleaded for the ending of trivial conflicts amongst Koreans of every background and political propensity, exhorting, ??Let??s stop internal fights completely! There is an adage: ??A little impatience spoils great plans.?? We must proceed onward from past affairs and, with inner resolve, tolerate one another.??For his instrumental role in promoting harmony within the Korean independence movement, Baekbeom is oft-commended and cited by Koreans, both left-leaning and right-leaning, and is consistently named among the most popular figures in Korean history. Consequently, his legacy is among the most misappropriated -- some in Korea have labeled him maximally ??leftist,?? some outside of Korea extreme ??rightist,?? while those who prize objectivity and have circumspectly examined the matter may be inclined to describe him, at least at the end, as a moderate or centrist. The Kim dynasty despots have also sought, most contemptibly, to capitalize on his atypical fame via a menagerie of infantile, wretched and elaborate fiction.? Baekbeom ardently implored for the total and unconditional halting of politically-motivated violence within the entreaty, urgently appealing to the conscience of his people. He pled, ??For once, let??s strive to forget about what is past. Do not be suspicious of one another and do not slander. Rather, we must appeal to each other??s true patriotism! Assassinations and destructiveness ... would only, in the end, impede our country??s emancipation. Let??s cease quarreling furiously amongst ourselves and cooperate with one another by way of a generous and warm heart!??Poignantly, Kim Koo went on to express admiration for Gandhi who, it is believed, was able to pardon his assassin even while dying. He confessed, ??I recently learned from Mahatma Gandhi. He is said to have placed his hand upon his forehead at the instant of being shot by an assassin, remembering to practice the virtue of forgiveness. I??ve known comparable ordeals such as being sentenced to death, and have been shot. Yet I??m ashamed to admit, at that time I lacked the courage to forgive my enemies. I??m quite embarrassed by my former inability to forgive, even now.??Then, what would Baekbeom counsel respecting Korea??s present situation?For one, those who brush aside mass atrocities which have been and continue to be perpetrated against Korea??s most helpless and defenseless populations within the North -- political prisoners who are entirely innocent, including thousands of children systematically starved, brutalized and forced to do slave labor unremittingly - are committing a grave error with severe implications. Baekbeom would have never condoned such callousness.In the entreaty, Kim Koo conveyed a tearful sense of foreboding and unadulterated compassion toward his compatriots north of the 38th Parallel, stating, ??Before I die, I want to see those who are from the north able to freely return home. When suffering difficult days, it seems I can hear the wailing of ghosts in the vicinity of the 38th Parallel. While sitting alone in the tranquil night, the reproachful and unhappy faces of poverty-stricken and starving compatriots of south and north seem to appear before me.??The citation at this article??s onset from My Wish establishes that Baekbeom would have been frankly aghast by the totalitarian prison North Korea has become; a genocidal system of sheer exploitation with pronounced similarities to fascist-era Japan, in terms of mechanisms and modes of oppression, as well as in the deification and compulsory religious worship of what is generally regarded anathema to communism -- hereditary dictatorship. Even a 1970 book issued by Pyongyang, preceding Kim Jong-il??s designation as his father??s successor, denounced hereditary succession as a ??reactionary custom of exploitative systems of the old days.?? By 1972 that bit was deleted from the North??s ??Political Dictionary.??Baekbeom would likewise be repulsed by the Kim dynasty??s discriminatory ways, which would evoke hardships he faced as a young man graded sangmin. Yet clearly, the Kim despots are architects of oppression unfathomably more heartless.Independent law firm Hogan Lovells determined the Kim dynasty??s murderous maltreatment, over decades, of many millions of Korea??s people cursed and condemned by the tyrants as comprising a ??hostile class?? not solely transgressed the legal threshold for crimes against humanity, but also genocide. The dynasty has been found to be committing atrocities of such gravity and on a scale the world has not witnessed since the Khmer Rouge or the Nazis, declared UN investigators not long ago.By Robert ParkRobert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience.

"148","[Herald Interview] Baltic States adorn tourism jewels",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Herald Interview] Baltic States adorn tourism jewels   THE KOREA HERALD June 12, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 12, 2017 Monday[Herald Interview] Baltic States adorn tourism jewels LENGTH: 1215 wordsAhead of their centenary of proclaiming statehood next year, the three Baltic countries have unveiled a myriad of tourism offers for international travelers, introducing the northern European nations as an integrated destination. As only Latvia among the Baltic States -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- has an embassy in Korea, the diplomatic mission organized a tourism promotion seminar in Seoul on May 15, where some 20 public tourism officials and numerous other travel company representatives participated. ??By promoting ourselves together as an integrated destination, we can consolidate our strengths and make ourselves more attractive to tourists,?? Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars told The Korea Herald in a separate interview at the embassy. ??Everything starts from an initial contact, which leads to better knowledge of each other and creation of durable links. Slowly but steadily, the number of Koreans visiting the Baltics is growing, roughly 10,000 annually.??To introduce the Baltic Year 2018 celebrations, the embassy is putting all efforts to strengthen tourism between Korea and the Baltic states, giving lectures at schools, universities and cultural organizations, as well as engaging with the media and participating in international events, the envoy added.The embassy, which recently relocated near Hangangjin Station in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, has produced a Baltic travel map with information on popular and hidden spots in Korean. The three nations are part of the Schengen Area: a zone comprising 26 European states that have abolished passport and border control at their mutual borders to encourage unrestricted travel. No visas are required to travel across the three countries for Koreans. The three states all use the euro currency. Riga is the largest city in any of the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia??s 2 million people. The Latvian capital has well-preserved architecture dating back to the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname ??the Pearl of the Baltic Sea.?? Designated the European Cultural Capital in 2014, it has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world. The capital??s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its many buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The city offers a myriad of festivals and performing arts throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet concerts and art exhibitions. Major events for next year are Lattelcom Riga Marathon in May, Riga Opera Festival in June, Riga City Festival in August and Staro Riga light festival in November. Estonia offers urban attractions, ecotourism and picturesque islands, among others. There are over 190 nationalities residing in the country of 1.3 million people, more than two-thirds of whom are Estonian. Most travelers spend the bulk of their time in Tallinn, which offers rich cultural and historical heritage, shopping venues, scenic beaches, spas, saunas and delectable cuisine. Other popular cities are Narva and Tartu, famous for architecture, wellness, nature and theater. Lithuania has a population of 3 million, and its capital is Vilnius. The country offers safe and secure tourism, unadulterated natural landscape, rich historical heritage, fast internet and ease of communication for foreigners, according to its State Department of Tourism. Vilnius has modernist buildings in Kaunaus and medieval capital Kernave, both included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. Historic city and lake resort Trakai, Baltic coastal city Klaipeda and the Hill of the Crosses are also popular.??Having emerged as independent states from the ashes of the First World War, the three Baltic countries share a common geographical, historical and cultural mentality,?? the ambassador explained, adding the region was under German, Swedish and Polish rule before the liberation. ??We understand that we can be more attractive when we are united. That??s why we all joined the European Union, eurozone, Schengen Area as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It??s important for us to be cooperating under the current volatile international situations and be part of these organizations. We also collaborate in step within the EU to have more attraction.??Strong mechanisms for cooperation exist for the Baltic States regarding EU matters, and they try to formulate similar or common positions to punch above their weight in global affairs, the diplomat added. He also said the three countries now operate many intercultural and economic linkages with one another, and compete in a ??positive and healthy way?? to spur growth and innovation.??There is positive competition between us that leads to healthy growth,?? according to Vaivars. ??We turn our eyes and ears to what is going on around us and envy any progress made by another neighbor. For example, if Estonia made strides in information communications and electronic government, Latvia wants to copy that and improve its own systems.??Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia regularly organize Baltic ministers?? meetings and interparliamentary meetings, as well as the ??3+5?? Baltic plus Nordic cooperation channels and Council of the Baltic Sea States assemblies. The Baltics are similar in many ways to the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, and consider themselves to be Nordic, the envoy said. ??The distance between Nordic and Baltic countries is getting shorter. My hope is that one day there won??t be any division between the Baltics and Nordics and there will be just Nordic countries. Another way to think of us is to look at the ??Benelux?? political and economic union of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.??Latvia, similar to its Baltic neighbors, was in dire straits with no governmental institutions and market economy following its liberation from the Soviet Union in 1991.??Latvia was the 10th richest country in Europe in 1939, but over 50 years of Soviet rule did huge damage to our economy,?? the ambassador stressed. ??Particularly as we feel more and more threats from our neighboring country Russia, we feel that the decisions that we made immediately after our independence in the early 1990s -- joining the strategic organizations EU and NATO -- were absolutely right.??Through the last 25 years, large differences were accrued and can be observed in countries that didn??t join these organizations, he added, noting they have developed economically at a slower pace and achieved little in reforms, while facing greater Russian influences in internal affairs.Highlighting that early exchanges through tourism will spark mutual interest and eventually lead to greater economic cooperation, Vaivars pointed to Latvia??s strengths in the wood and timber, furniture and interior design, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, cosmetics and fashion industries, with Korea being the second-largest export market in Asia, after China.The delegation at the maiden tourism seminar in May included officials from the Riga Tourism Development Bureau, Baltic Travel Group, Con-ex Latvia Tours Group and Estravel Latvia.

Frankie DaPonte, Hunter Kohl, Sime Kosta and Koki Tomlinson ? was refreshing, like a boost of New York City energy.The four were simply young aspiring artists in New York when they auditioned for a graduate student's project about K-pop. Today, they are a K-pop band that has flown in to Seoul to train and record their debut album.Some K-pop bands have foreign members, like the girl band Twice that has four foreign members out of nine. EXP Edition's members are all foreign, and their pure love for the stage has shone through. They are challenging themselves, what K-pop is and how far it can go.On entering their agency's building in Daebangdong, Seoul, they almost shouted out 'Annyeonghaseyo, EXP Edition imnida' (Hello, we are EXP Edition). The expression, a standard way by which K-pop bands greet their fans, shows the bands' cohesion and strict discipline in training and performing.The members were full of energy and enthusiasm amid the heat and uncertainty about reception about the upcoming album. Just the day before, they recorded one of their new songs.'I remember the first time we stepped into the booth to record ¡®Luv/Wrong,' which has been the biggest challenge for us,' Sime said, to which Koki immediately added, '(There were) four lines of Korean.''It made no sense, and it was difficult to understand what I was singing. The story is little different now. The background knowledge of Korean gives us more artistic freedom,' Sime said.'Our new song is closer to hip-hop than before. I am excited for the response of K-pop fans when they hear it for the first time,' Frankie said.EXP Edition started out as a project for Kim Bo-ra's master of fine arts thesis at Columbia University. Kim developed a hypothesis about what it would be like to start a K-pop boy band with non-Korean members. She posted a notice on an online casting site for artists and models in New York in 2014 and ultimately chose the four out of 2,000 applicants. They then released 'Luv/Wrong' in 2015, getting a lot of attention and criticism that there were no Korean members and for their Korean pronunciation. But the four decided to move to Seoul and released 'Feel Like This' this in April, re-encountering criticism.The members, who have no Korean background ? Frankie who is Portuguese-American; Koki, Japanese-American originally from Texas; Hunter, an American from Long Island, and Sime, Croatian-American from New York ? face the challenge of learning the Korean language. Frankie is a soccer player turned actor and dancer; Sime a child pop star from Croatia; Koki is a model; and Hunter, an actor.'We have at least two days of Korean lessons every day on top of practice and appearances on Korean shows,' Sime said. 'The pronunciation is very difficult,' he added in Korean. The band now have a Korean-language learning show on YouTube. (www.youtube.com/EXPEDITIONTV). Also see them on https://www.facebook.com/expedition.immabb/'When we first started out and got that reaction, it was a perfect opportunity to second-guess,' Frankie said. But the four are here in Seoul, doing what they love.'It was initially shocking,' said Koki, referring to the criticisms for their incorrect Korean pronunciations and some racist comments regarding the lack of Koreans in the band.But Hunter saw the criticism from a different perspective. 'We weren't surprised with the negative attention since we already knew what happens in entertainment when a new artist or concept drops ? everyone is reluctant to accept it,' he said, prompting strange looks from his fellow members.The four are undergoing the K-pop band training system, including going by their first names and living and practicing together. Their agency, IMMABB, has rented an apartment for them near its office.'It took a little getting used to,' said Frankie, the band's front man, about their current lifestyle.But Koki said it was nice to focus completely on what they want to do.When Kim's notice first appeared, they joined in thinking that it would be an experiment, but now they hope for something larger. 'It has become something bigger than my project. You cannot plan this, I always think like, and something we have together is precious,' Kim said.The members had respective exposures to K-pop, and find the music and the performance energetic and intriguing and the community inclusive.'Artists who perform K-pop try to obtain perfection. There is this expectation of a perfect image. Their skin, visual aesthetic for music videos, and the television shows are perfect. This longing for perfection is a reason they have this crazy training system,' Frankie said.What would they like to contribute to K-pop?'We hope to bring more opportunities for people who want to do K-pop,' Koki said. 'We hope K-pop can become bigger in the United States,' said Frankie.Now they are ready to top the charts and attend year-end award shows.Away from home, the members find the Korean 'samgyeopsal,' or pork belly goes a long way to comfort them.What really comes to their minds at the end of a long day at their Seoul apartment?'Acceptance of this new community that we have come to is in the back of my mind, personally,' Frankie said.'We want people to eventually only to talk about our music,' Hunter said.'I am scared that a lot of Korean people think that we are doing this for fun, and it's not a permanent thing,' Sime said. 'It's not like that at all.''There is no end date on what we're doing. It's just how far we can go with it,' Koki said.The Korea Times intern Yenah Jang contributed to this article.EXP Edition members pose in the street outside of their agency office in Daebang-dong, Seoul. / Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chulLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (92%); POP & ROCK (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (89%); MUSIC (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (75%); RECORD RELEASES (74%); HIP HOP CULTURE (71%); RAP MUSIC (64%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); NEW YORK, NY, USA (88%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (90%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); UNITED STATES (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: August 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The choir consists of 50 members who are current or former employees of the UN. The group travels around the world visiting one or two countries every year to perform, each member wearing the traditional attire of his or her country. The choir makes special visits to areas that have been struck by natural disasters or atrocities to provide physical and psychological support.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the choir and the performance in Korea will be a special performance to celebrate the organization's anniversary as well as one promoting harmony and love for humanity.The choir will hold five performances in five locations _ the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), Goyang, Pyeongchang, Gwangju and Seoul_ from Aug. 27 through Sept. 4.The first performance will be held at Camp Greaves in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, an American military base near the DMZ, Aug. 27. The first performance was chosen to be held at the military base to send a message of peace to the public. A group of displaced people will be invited to the event to share and soothe their pain.The following day, the choir will perform in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, at the Aram Concert Hall of the Aram Nuri Arts Center. The performance will support the city's aim to become a ""peace and unification metropolitan city"" by 2020. The performance hall is suited for classical concerts and can accommodate around 1,400 people.In Pyeongchang on Aug. 29, the choir will wish for a successful hosting of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics as well as for its venue becoming a place for peaceful collaboration between global citizens.On Aug. 31, the choir will perform in Gwangju's Chosun University Haeoreumgwan. The group will invite citizen choirs to perform with them as part of a collaborative cultural event.On Sept. 4, the choir will hold their final performance in Seoul at the Lotte Concert Hall in Jamsil, Songpa-gu. The last performance will be a celebratory event for the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the choir and for peace and collaboration among all people. Many local and foreign dignitaries are expected to attend the event and the choir will collaborate with a local television channel to broadcast the concert.""Music has an immense power to unite people and to generate understanding. It is a universal language of peace. War is never inevitable. It is always a matter of choice: the choice to exclude, to discriminate, to marginalize, and to resort to violence. By restoring trust between governments and their citizens and among countries, we can prevent and avoid conflict,"" said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a message for the performances of the choir in July, while celebrating the event.""But peace, too, is never inevitable. It is the result of difficult decisions, hard work and compromise. We should never take it for granted; but should prize and nurture it in every country, at every time. I wish you every success in using the power of music to foster peace.""The choir plans to hold a performance in North Korea's capital Pyongyang in the near future. The choir initially had hoped to perform in both Seoul and Pyongyang during this trip but it was not possible this time around due to complex political issues on the peninsula. The choir will be travelling to Japan following its visit to Korea.The admission fee will be 30,000 won for all performances.

Genres continue to be limited to political thrillers and crime flicks, and the lack of female roles persists. Despite the lack of diversity, however, 2017 turned out to be a year that offered several pleasant, unexpected surprises for moviegoers. Quieter, more pensive films excelled this year, offering insight into humanity and the everyday. OkjaAdventure, fantasy Directed by Bong Joon-ho Distributed by Netflix, Next Entertainment World'Okja' is a film full of heart, an optimistic story that also peers into some of the most twisted aspects of a social order mankind has created for themselves. ã€€Vegetarians and environmentalists hailed the film as an effective campaign tool against the mass-production of meat, and though it makes an excellent case, the film is much more than an advocate for green eating. It speaks of universal issues such as the need for empathy, the inevitable pang of growing up and facing a vicious world, the inhumane order of capitalism and the terrible consequences that one person's envy can cause. ã€€At once a coming-of-age tale, satire and good old-fashioned adventure ride, led by the indefatigable young heroine Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun), 'Okjaï'once again proves director Bong's unique sensitivity and intellect. It includes picturesque Korean landscapes, large-scale yet detailed chase scenes, a richly layered story and an equally diverse cast. The FortressHistorical dramaDirected by Hwang Dong-hyuk Distributed by CJ Entertainment In Korea, dozens of period pieces are made every year for both film and television, but 'The Fortressï'is that rare example of a historical drama that appreciates history in all its complexity. ã€€It also invites viewers to ponder philosophical issues through characters who seem to adhere to a higher moral standard than the modern bureaucrat. The year is 1636. The location, Namhansanseong, a mountain fortress southeast of Seoul. Joseon's King Injo (Park Hae-il), his advisers and people are trapped within its walls in the freezing winter, unable to escape from or fight against a Chinese invasion. ã€€At the center of the film lies the ideological struggle that ensues as the king's two highest advisors -- Choi Myung-gil (Lee Byung-hun) and Kim Sang-hun (Kim Yoon-seok) -- fiercely debate on the course of action to take. Choi opts to surrender, arguing that life and survival precede lofty ideals, while Kim, staunchly believing that the only meaningful life is one with honor and dignity, argues Joseon should fight even if it means death. ã€€The film's debate mirrors the philosophical tension that was pervasive throughout the Joseon era; some scholars today argue that it was Joseon's excessive emphasis on form and formality that led to its demise. In the film, both arguments, meanwhile, pale when compared to the brutal reality of people dying from frostbite and starvation. The Running ActressDrama, comedyDirected by Moon So-ri Distributed by MetaplayHumorous, intelligent and reflective, this is a gem of a film and the directorial feature debut of acclaimed actress Moon So-ri, known for films such as 'Oasis.ï'Moon, who penned, directed and starred in the film, tells a semi-autobiographical three-part story about the daily life of an actress, which usually begins and ends in a breakdown in her van. ã€€Moon struggles with the gap between the cachet people place on actresses -- 'You must not eat (cheap) food like this!ï'-- and the painfully menial, often demeaning, details of her actual daily routine. With a livelihood that relies so heavily on 'personal charmï'and 'beauty,ï'the actress perennially wavers between confidence in her skills, the courage to ask for better roles and intense insecurity. The film ends with a stirring contemplation on art and life. The First LapDramaDirected by Kim Dae-hwan Distributed by Indieplug With his sophomore feature, Kim Dae-hwan proves once again that he has a keen eye for capturing the real Korean family. His debut work 'End of Winterï'observed how deep-seated resentments begin manifesting themselves after a family is snowed in in their hometown. ã€€'The First Lapï'focuses on a young couple as they attempt to navigate adult life, meet each other's families and evade, for as long as possible, that daunting institution of marriage for fear of turning out like their respective parents. In two achingly naturalistic performances that were in large part adlibbed, according to director Kim, Jo Hyun-chul and Kim Sae-byuk bring to life a thoroughly average millennial Korean couple and all their blunders. The MercilessCrime, actionDirected by Byun Sung-hyunDistributed by CJ Entertainment Director Byun made an explosive debut with the stylish noir 'The Merciless,ï'which was invited to Cannes Film Festival's midnight screenings in May. ã€€The value of this film lies in its style -- its bold, vintage colors, the meticulous arrangement of the buildings and people -- and how it follows the emotions of its two lead characters, the seemingly hardened gangster Han Jae-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) and reckless young delinquent Jo Hyun-soo (Im Si-wan). Their relationship evolves to become deeper than a bromance and more calculated than a romance. The film's box office numbers, meanwhile, received a blow due to public outrage at director Byun's sexual tweets about his actors, for which the director subsequently apologized. Distinctly 'Koreanï'films that soothed the souls of Koreans 'A Taxi Driver,ï'directed by Jang Hoon, became the 11th most-viewed Korean film of all time. Through the movie, we see that through the efforts of one taxi driver -- played by the always enjoyable Song Kang-ho -- and a relentless German journalist, Korea's May 18 Democratic Uprising, where hundreds were killed while protesting the military government, became known to the world. 'I Can Speak,ï'directed by Kim Hyeon-suk, also deals with Korea's lingering pain from history. The elderly Na Ok-boon (Na Moon-hee) is a neighborhood busybody who pesters civil servant Park Min-jae (Lee Je-hoon) for English lessons. It turns out that Na was forced into military sexual slavery in her youth by the Japanese. By learning English, she exposes Japan's crimes on the international stage. Spectacular computer graphics Ryoo Seung-wan's 'The Battleship Islandï'recreated almost in its entirety Japan's Hashima Island, where Korean people were forced into slave labor by the Japanese, both using a set and through computer graphics. The film shows large-scale explosions in the narrow underground coal mines, Korean laborersï'decrepit living conditions and a rebellion that breaks out among the workers. ã€€ Kim Yong-hwa's 'Along with the Gods: The Two Worldsï'offered another example of sheer scale and spectacle. It created a vast fantasy world of the afterlife, from the burning hell of lava to sprawling deserts and towering waterfalls. The graphics were undertaken by Kim's Dexter Studios, one of Asia's leading motion picture production studios. Daring films that attempted to transcend genre Director Lee Sa-rang's 'Real,ï'starring Kim Soo-hyun, caused a small sensation when it was released in June. With blaring electronic visuals (so much red lighting), a plot that attempted to intertwine the present, the past, the psyche, and reality, and explicit sex scenes, the film was incomprehensible and utterly new -- though perhaps not in the best way. It is worth noting for its courage in breaking all rules. Shin Su-won's 'Glass Gardenï'features a scientist (Moon Geun-young) who isolates herself in the forest in order to research blood. She discovers a way to create 'green bloodï'by infusing blood with chloroplasts, and dreams of one day turning into a tree. The novelty of the premise led it to open this year's Busan International Film Festival.

A bomb blast tore through a subway train deep under Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg April 3, killing several people and wounding many more in a chaotic scene that left victims sprawled on a smoky platform. / AP-YonhapRussian Ambassador to Korea Alexander TimoninRussia's envoy speaks about attackThe April 3 blast on the St. Petersburg metro system will never be justified as it was a crime against all of humanity and against all religions without exception, Russia's top envoy says.'I would also like to remind that terrorism has no nationality,' Russian Ambassador to Korea Alexander Timonin told The Korea Times. 'It is also unacceptable to connect terrorism with someone's national background or religious beliefs.'On April 3, the blast ripped through an underground train in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, killing 14 and injuring 50 more. So far no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, and investigators have not announced a motive.The suspected bomber was one of the 14 killed; authorities identified him as 22-year-old Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen.This attack was known as the worst terrorist attack outside the North Caucasus since two suicide bombers killed 32 people in Volgograd in four years ago.'Whatever were their motives, another thing is the point of utmost importance. Terrorism will never be justified,' the diplomat said. 'This is the common approach of the whole international community.'The diplomat said that it was too early to talk about any organizations at the present stage, which could stand behind humand crime in St. Petersburg.According to the Russian Investigation Committee, the personality of the suicide bomber who committed the blast in the subway train is identified, but nevertheless the investigation process is underway, and Russia would be able to determine the organization responsible for the terrorist attack only upon completion of the investigation, he added.'I am convinced that solidarity, which was expressed not only by our allies but also by virtually all the states and what is more significant, by common people, reflects understanding of the necessity to join efforts in fight against terrorism,' the ambassador said.'I would also like to use this opportunity and express my sincere appreciation to acting President of Korea Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se for passing words of support and condolences to the Russian government and people.'Flowers are laid in front of Embassy of Russia on April 4. / Courtesy of Russian EmbassyTo root out terrorism around the world, Moscow has made efforts to fight it and remain constant for many years, Timonin said.'The President of the Russian Federation thoroughly introduced Russian views at the fight against terrorism at the General Assembly of the United Nations 70th Session in September 2015 and reiterated it recently during phone conversations with U.S. President and leaders of Turkey, Japan, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia and other countries who called after the tragedy to express their condolences,' the envoy said.Calling terrorism a 'global threat undermining security of all the countries of the world,' Timonin said that in these circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make declarations about the threat of terrorism and at the same time turn a blind eye to the channels used to finance and support terrorists, including revenues from drug trafficking, the illegal oil trade and the arms trade.'It is equally irresponsible to manipulate extremist groups and use them to achieve someone's political goals, hoping that later one will find a way to get rid of terrorists or somehow eliminate them. We consider that any attempts to flirt with terrorists, let alone arm them, are shortsighted and criminal acts,' he said.'Russia proposes to draw upon common values and common interests rather than ambitions. Relying on international law, we must join efforts to address the problems that all of us are facing, and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism. Terrorism is an evil that must be fought by joint efforts.'After the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences and sympathy to the families of those killed and injured.The president said he spoke with representatives of security agencies and the FSB director. Its law enforcement and security agencies have been working to establish the cause of the explosion and provide their assessments of the situation. City authorities, and if needed, federal authorities, will take the necessary measures to help the families of those affected by the blast, the leader said.'The reasons behind it are not clear yet, and so it would be premature to speak about them. The investigation is ongoing,' Putin said.'Of course, we always consider all scenarios, including accidental or criminal action, and above all, those of a terrorist nature.

Korea leader can be referred to ICC if found to be behind killing 'LENGTH: 264 wordsA legal adviser to the International Criminal Court (ICC) argued the leader of North Korea can be referred to the world judicial body if found to be behind the killing of his estranged half brother, a U.S. broadcaster reported Thursday.North Korea is widely believed to have orchestrated the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of the rogue regime's leader Kim Jong-un, last month in Malaysia by agents using deadly VX nerve agent.""That could be something that may allow the UN Security Council or even the ICC to hold him up, if, again if, you can show that they were behind it because of the nature of, type of substance used in that,"" the lawyer was quoted by Voice of America as saying.""With the ICC, it always ... it goes up the ladder, you find the person who was ultimately responsible. You don't actually go and charge the people at the bottom. So there is a precedent for ... ultimately you go for the leader who ordered even if you were not involved in actual planning. If you ordered, sanctioned the killing, that makes you liable.""In 2014, the UN General Assembly voted to refer North Korea to the ICC for crimes against humanity, after a Commission of Inquiry report documented ongoing atrocities in North Korea that included incarcerating over 120,000 people in political prisons, as well as systematic abuses that included torture, enslavement, rape and murder, according to the VOA report.The measure has since stalled in the UN Security Council, where Pyongyang's allies - China and Russia - are believed to be preventing it from coming to a vote, it said.

They also think the advantages of learning a foreign language at an early age outweigh - if there are any - its costs in the long term.'I do not understand the pedagogical motivation for this policy at all,' Robert Kluender, a linguistics professor at the University of California San Diego, told The Korea Times. 'Is it based on any research? It doesn't sound like it. Limited exposure to a second language for an hour or two a day in a school or preschool setting is never going to supplant the dominant language of the culture that children otherwise hear and speak at home and in other settings on a daily basis.'Richard Donato, a professor in the University of Pittsburgh's instruction and learning department, agrees. He believes the limited amount of time children study a foreign language would 'never exert a negative impact on the development of the mother tongue.''There is no evidence whatsoever that an early start to foreign language learning has any negative impact on the development of oral or literacy abilities in the mother tongue,' he said. 'What occurs in most cases is just the opposite. The mother tongue influences foreign language learning.'So contrary to popular misconception, it is not the case that exposure to a second language at any time during childhood before adolescence will yield equivalent outcomes. 'The clock starts ticking from birth with regard to ultimate language proficiency,' Kluender said.About 7,000 afterschool English teachers at elementary schools across Korea will lose their jobs in March when the Ministry of Education's policy comes into force. The ministry also plans to apply the policy to children at kindergartens and daycare centers, which is expected to affect tens of thousands more teachers.Apart from the job crisis, according to the scholars, the ministry will do children a disservice by pushing ahead with the policy.Over the past 25 years, numerous studies have shown that the earlier children are exposed to a second language, the better their ultimate proficiency in it will be.'In other words, the later the first exposure to a second language in childhood, the less proficient that individual will be in it in the long term,' Kluender said. 'It is only children who are exposed to a second language at very early ages who eventually (with continued exposure to the language) approach native speaker proficiency on a variety of measures.'Some studies have even shown a break in ultimate proficiency between children exposed to the second language before and after five or six years of age. In view of this, delaying first exposure to English until about eight years of age (third grade) seems like utter folly.'One of the most evident disadvantages of not starting to learn a foreign language at an early age is the hurdle of acquiring its pronunciation.Many Koreans find English pronunciation difficult to master. Kluender reckons delaying first exposure to English only serves to help guarantee that this will continue.In the case of a fully bilingual situation, or an English immersion environment, children may experience confusion of learning different languages at the same time for the first few years but they catch up and often outperform their monolingual counterparts by around 10 years old, the scholars said.'There is research to suggest that while learning a foreign language early might initially slow down learning of the first language, the effect is short-lived, and indeed, after a while, the insight a child gains through learning a foreign language (or languages) will overall be highly beneficial,' Keith Johnson, an emeritus professor of linguistics and language education at Lancaster University, said.Many experts The Korea Times contacted said the ministry's policy lacks logic and benefits nobody.In fact, teachers and parents of children alike have raised their voices against the policy here, saying it will only deepen the English gap between children from rich families who can just send them to expensive, fully private English academies and the ones who cannot afford it.'Additionally, children do not learn their mother tongue error free, whether they learn a foreign language or not,' Donato said. 'They will always develop their first language in ways that do not mirror adult grammar. This will have nothing to do with learning a foreign language. This is the natural course of language development.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (93%); CHILDREN (92%); LINGUISTICS (91%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); LANGUAGE ACQUISITION (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (89%); MULTILINGUALISM (89%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (89%); HUMAN EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT (89%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (89%); APPLIED LINGUISTICS (89%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); CHILD CARE (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); ADOLESCENTS (77%); LAYOFFS (62%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (56%); UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH (55%)CITY: SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (79%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 12, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"155","Why Korean street fashion is important",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"September","Why Korean street fashion is important  Korea Times September 11, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesSeptember 11, 2017 MondayWhy Korean street fashion is importantBYLINE: By Michael HurtLENGTH: 773 wordsThis look says bigger things more important than its obvious message of 'DENIM AND RIPS ARE BACK.' Not only is she very on-trend, she has added an additional, literally subtextual layer of sexuality suggested by the fishnets, which most of the paepi were making a point of wearing outside of their pants as well as in. / Courtesy of Michael HurtI'm not a fashion guy. I'm not a fashionable guy. I'm not really into fashion. But I do find Korean street fashion endlessly, academically fascinating. I always have, since stumbling into its direction through my photography around late 2006. Nowadays, I teach using my experience in the actual fashion field, as the first street fashion photographer in Korea, having shot street fashion seriously and continuously, in the actual streets with actual real, random subjects (no preset models), from 2006 until the present day. I've been shooting street fashion portraits at Seoul Fashion Week from 2007 until now. But it wasn't for the fashion, per se. I also use my photographs as social data, since my field of specialization is in visual sociology. When I have taught visual sociology at both Korea and Yonsei Universities in the past, I have always utilized street fashion as a case study and even sent my students to do photographs and ethnographic interviews with so-called 'paepi' (Korean portmanteau for 'fashion people' in English) at Seoul Fashion Week.Looking at fashion is a fascinating thing to do academically and intellectually, especially since so much social communication is going on through clothing-as-cultural-texts. And if you want to listen to and watch this conversation as a sociologist, it can tell you a lot about what's going on in society. You can also use the case of Korean fashion to study the truly unique, twice-a-year fashion industry event known as Seoul Fashion Week, which has become a cultural institution for street fashion folks and a new kind of socially unusual, un-Korean space of social openness and liberal sartorial norms, which itself was enabled by the housing of the event in, around, and at the 'alien' DDP structure sitting in the middle of Dongdaemun since 2012.Urban studies people might call the study of the paepi congregating at DDP and how their culture is related to physical space and structures 'human geography.' Because the DDP is interesting not just because of the architecture alone, it is also interesting how the building defines an alien space for social aliens.In this way, street fashion in Korea isn't interesting just because of the clothes. (Since I'll refer to 'street fashion' as just 'fashion' from now on, stick with me.) Fashion in Korea isn't inherently interesting. Trends change but pretty much stay the same. Debating about what's coming next season or what particular trend is cool or not is like debating about whether or not you're a good person because you do or don't like the color royal blue, or whether you like French or Russian caviar. It's pointless.But what is awesome about Korean street fashion culture isn't the amazing styling, although you can like it for that if you want to; it isn't the sub-cultural aspects, because there aren't any, really. The Korean paepi do not really constitute a counterculture, or really any significant sub-cultural values different from the mainstream. Instead, the paepi are fascinating as a new class of Korean super-consumers, as a group of youth who have found a way to gain social validation quickly and efficiently as super-consumers who have transformed what Marx called a 'commodity fetish' (Warenfetischismus) into a creative endeavor. They flipped a failing of capitalism into a veritable art form. They turned consumption into creation.And that's what any sociologist worth his or her salt should be making an extra special priority to be researching in Korea right now. What surprises me (although not really, given what I know about the state of the field here) is that I know of not a single Korean sociologist looking at the burgeoning street fashion culture and scene in Korea. Not. A. Single. One. That's one reason I do what I do, in addition to simply thinking that street fashion is one of the most authentic and viably international forms of hallyu culture today and one of the most interesting markers of social change in Korea.Michael Hurt (@kuraeji on Instagram) is a photographer and professor living in Seoul.

Buy yourself more free time    THE KOREA HERALD July 30, 2017 Sunday   THE KOREA HERALDJuly 30, 2017 Sunday[Ashley Whillans, Elizabeth W. Dunn] Want to be happier? Buy yourself more free time  LENGTH: 785 wordsIt might seem lazy to hire a housecleaner or pay the kid next door to mow your lawn. But our new research suggests that spending money to buy yourself free time is an effective -- and underused -- way to promote your happiness.We asked more than 6,000 people in North America and Europe whether they spent money on time-saving services. Across both continents, survey-takers who bought their way out of cleaning, cooking, household maintenance and other pesky tasks reported greater life satisfaction. It didn??t matter if they were rich or poor: The surveys revealed that people who buy time are happier.To find out if buying time actually causes greater happiness, we conducted a more direct experiment among 60 working adults in Vancouver, Canada.The experiment took place over two consecutive weekends.During one weekend, we gave people $40 to spend on a time-saving purchase. Some paid for cleaning services; others had groceries delivered to their home; one woman hired the ??neighborhood boy?? to run errands on her behalf.During the other weekend, we gave the same people $40 to spend on a material good. People bought a variety of items, including new clothes, the board game Cards Against Humanity and what one woman described as ??fancy wine.??When we asked people how happy they felt afterward, the results were clear: Spending money on time-saving purchases left people in a better mood than spending money on material things.Our results suggest that buying time boosts happiness by mitigating the effects of time stress the feeling that there aren??t enough hours in the day. The feeling of being pressed for time is typically linked to lower life satisfaction, and we observed this well-established link in the lives of most of the people we surveyed. What??s striking is that the detrimental effect of time stress disappeared among people who used money to buy time.It might seem obvious that eliminating miserable tasks from daily life should reduce time stress and promote happiness. Yet, we were surprised to discover, even people who can readily afford time-saving services often don??t spend money on them.When we surveyed hundreds of millionaires in the Netherlands, almost half reported that they spent no money to outsource their unenjoyable tasks in a typical month. Similarly, when we asked 98 working adults in Canada how they would spend an extra $40, only 2 percent said they would spend money on time-saving services. Many said they would buy pleasurable experiences, such as going to the ballet, and about half said they would use some of the money to benefit others, to treat a friend to a movie, for example. While research shows these are also good ways of turning money into happiness, the 2 percent figure suggests that buying time is an overlooked route to better well-being.While researchers and policymakers have devoted a great deal of attention to promoting financial affluence, our research points to the importance of time affluence. Our findings are backed up by a pilot time-banking program at the Stanford School of Medicine. As part of this program, hospital administrators rewarded faculty members with vouchers for time-saving services, such as meal delivery, laundry services and housecleaning.The results were striking. Doctors who participated in the program reported a 20 percent increase in the likelihood that they would stay at Stanford University for the foreseeable future. They also reported greater work-life balance. As one doctor commented: ??Instead of spending countless hours cleaning and cooking, I can actually accomplish work for Stanford in a timely manner. I can also rest at night in a clean home having eaten a decent meal.??The rewards of time-saving might prove especially effective for women. While women have gained better access to educational opportunities in recent decades, their life satisfaction has steadily declined. This downward slide could reflect the challenges of working during the day, then returning home to the ??second shift?? of household chores. Spending money on time-saving services is likely to lessen the negative effects of women??s second shift and reduce gender-based inequalities in well-being.Don??t think about time-saving services as the lazy option. Think of buying time as an escape hatch from the excessive time pressure of modern life. As we??ve both informed our husbands, the benefits of this strategy are now supported by science.By Ashley V.

The networking opportunity and lecture for a select group of people invited four of the most prominent designers and architects of today -- Claudio Bellini, Baek Hee-sung, George Popescu and Jung Sung-gi -- to share their philosophies on design.'To design something is to give an identity, a soul to something. When you see something, you want to feel and embrace it like a soul,' said Bellini, CEO and founder of Claudio Bellini Design+Design.The leading Italian designer explained that all his projects share the same idea of design crossing borders. He also demonstrated the mottos that he employs for the projects, including 'fantastic dimension to our dreams,ï''encasing memoriesï'and 'back to childhood.ï'Bellini said he does not believe in a design coming simply from a designer's sketch; rather, cooperation between a designer and a client is necessary for the design to bear fruit. 'What is important is that a product doesn't come out from a single person. Like a baby, it needs a mother and a father: Designer and client,ï'he said. Bellini said that through design, one is able to mix functions to a kind of identity to give it a symbolic value.Architect Baek Hee-sung, CEO of KEAB Architecture Design, continued the theme of 'power of design to change the future.ï'When building structures, Baek explained that his most important material is the memory.'It's not the history, but memory. Because history is something that everyone shares, whereas a memory is more personal,ï'he said. 'What we focus on is that people are all different, and I think it is because we all experience different things.'As memory is refined in a person's head to form his or her personality, a building also has its own memories.He gave an example of how as structure can reflect a memory through a project on a local glasses shop he completed. The shop owner's life and work, while precious on its own, was hardly reflected in the tiny shop. Baek redesigned the place to show the owner's hard work and diligence -- for example by emphasizing the workplace to the visitors -- which helped demonstrate his values through design.Romanian entrepreneur George Popescu spoke about the new way of thinking through design in the technological age. Through augmented reality envisioned by his software company Lampix, he uses a projector to display images onto traditional surfaces like kitchen tables, desks and coffee tables, rather than usual smart surfaces. He explained that the technology could be incorporated into various fields such as shopping. Sung Jung-gi, product designer and creative director of Daylight, expressed hopes that his designs would spark people to think. The Korean designer who says that 'humanity should be at the center of all designsï'said that he wanted people to think about things that can be glossed over -- such as quality of water and the waste that people throw out -- through his works.By Yoon Min-sik (minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICES (79%); ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES (78%); SOCIAL NETWORKING (71%); SOFTWARE MAKERS (71%); EXECUTIVES (68%); AUGMENTED REALITY (60%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (50%)LOAD-DATE: November 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

They are, from left, Kim Boo-kyum as interior minister; Do Jong-hwan as culture, sports and tourism minister; Kim Hyun-mee as land, infrastructure and transport minister; and Kim Young-choon as oceans and fisheries minister. / YonhapBy Kim RahnPresident Moon Jae-in has nominated four lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) as ministers Tuesday, according to Cheong Wa Dae.The latest nominations come amid controversy over alleged irregularities in Moon's earlier nominations, including Prime Minister nominee Lee Nak-yon.Rep. Kim Boo-kyum was tapped for minister of the interior. Presidential spokesman Park Soo-hyun said he will help achieve the new government's goal of balanced national development and unity.'The four-term lawmaker has contributed to reforming society and overcoming regionalism, by often giving up his vested rights,' Park said.'We believe his expertise in decentralization will help set up a new relationship between the central and regional governments and build a national administrative system for balanced development.'Born in Sangju, North Gyeongsang Province, the 59-year-old majored in political science at Seoul National University and obtained a master's degree in public administration at Yonsei University. He served three terms as a lawmaker for Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province, and one for Daegu.Kim attempted to run for the presidency earlier this year but dropped out of the party's primary due to a low support rate. He then worked for Moon's election camp.Do as culture ministerFor culture, sports and tourism minister, Moon named Rep. Do Jong-hwan, who made a name for himself as a poet before entering politics.'Do, who was a nationally recognized poet, has worked for ordinary citizens as a lawmaker. He has protested against powers that attempted to dominate the people, and has never hesitated to support the people,' Park said.'He is suitable to lead the culture ministry, which has many urgent reform issues, based on his insights into culture and his experience on the National Assembly Culture Committee.'The culture ministry has been at the center of the corruption scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye, who allegedly ordered it to create a blacklist of artists critical of the government to exclude them from state subsidies. Former Minister Cho Yoon-sun was arrested over the allegation.'The new government's basic policy for culture is support without intervention. We hope Do will produce a dynamic cultural community,' Park said.Do, 63, from Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, obtained his doctorate in Korean language education at Chungnam National University. He entered politics as a lawmaker in 2012. Do attempted to prevent the Park government's state-authored history textbook, and during the presidential scandal, he offered evidence for the blacklist allegation.The former poet wrote a poem dedicated to the late President Roh Moo-hyun and read it during a May 23 memorial service.Female land ministerRep. Kim Hyun-mee was named as land, infrastructure and transport minister, the first female to lead the ministry if the nomination is confirmed.Majoring in political diplomacy at Yonsei University, the 55-year-old worked for the Roh administration in 2003 and afterward was elected as a lawmaker three times.'Kim has experience in both the Assembly and government. She was also the first female head of the National Assembly Special Committee on Budget and Accounts last year, helping the smooth passage of the budget bill,' Park said.Fisheries ministerFor oceans and fisheries minister, Moon named Rep. Kim Young-choon, 55, who is head of the National Assembly Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee.'We believe the three-term lawmaker can help revive the shipping industry, protect the fisheries industry and re-examine the truth of the ferry Sewol sinking,' Park said.Kim Young-choon majored in English literature at Korea University and obtained a master's degree in political diplomacy.The four nominees must undergo Assembly confirmation hearings, although their appointments do not require parliamentary approval.The nominations come a day after Moon sought public understanding over irregularities regarding other nominees, including Prime Minister-designate Lee, whose position requires the Assembly's approval. Moon said his government would soon come up with new criteria in selecting ranking officials.The DPK welcomed Tuesday's nominations, saying the party will actively cooperate with the government in resolving pending issues.But the main opposition Liberty Korea Party disapproved. 'It is a dogmatic attitude of the Moon government to ignore the opposition parties while announcing nominees without presenting new criteria,' it said in a statement. 'It is also a reward to DPK members who helped Moon's campaign.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (91%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (89%); POLITICS (89%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (89%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (89%); PRIMARY ELECTIONS (79%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (79%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); SCANDALS (75%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (73%); HISTORY (72%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (72%); CERTIFICATES  DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (71%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (70%); TEXTBOOKS (70%); CORRUPTION (70%); ARRESTS (70%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (70%); PRIME MINISTERS (70%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (70%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (68%); WRITERS (67%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (62%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (57%); FISHERIES (57%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (94%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (57%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: May 30, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Thirty minutes will be provided for each article.All the news articles will be chosen randomly, according to the organizers. Their translations will be evaluated on accuracy, according to the organizers.'Human translators and interpreters and those who seek to do these jobs in the future are increasingly facing concerns that they may lose their presence as AI-based automatic translating technologies have rapidly been improved,' IITA Secretary-General Kang Dae-young said.'Though the event may not completely dispel such worries, we hope to confirm that humans and machines have different strengths and weaknesses and highlight that human professionals will still have their roles in translation and interpretation of the future.'Automatic translation programs using machines have been fast improved thanks to the introduction of a technology called the neural machine translation (NMT) since 2015.Before the NMT, programs worked based on a paradigm called the statistical machine translation (SMT), which produces translations on statistical analysis of bilingual text corpora. In this way, these programs translated the original text word-by-word and this has led to errors or awkward expressions.But the NMT translates a whole sentence at a time. It utilizes machine learning and big data analysis and thus is capable of self-improving its translation, resulting in higher accuracy in time.Tapping into the NMT technology, Naver launched its translation program Papago in October last year. Following in November, Google applied the technology for its Translate service.Sejong University English Language and Literature professor Kwak Eun-joo, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Graduate School of Translation and Interpretation professor Kwak Joong-chol and professional tech writer and translator Cho Gil-ja will take charge of evaluating and judging the competition.Sejong Cyber University said it will provide a real-time stream of the event on its website.Expectations are that the human translator may win the showdown in terms of the quality of translation, though the AI-based programs will outperform their human counterparts in speed.'Though AI translation programs are superfast, they cannot rectify errors that they have already made,' a source from the translation industry said. 'But humans can polish their draft work to improve the degree of completion.'A freelance interpreter here said, 'We may not say that the upcoming event is the ultimate showdown between human translators and machines. But soon, I believe machines are highly likely to surpass humans because they are rapidly evolving by accumulating massive amounts of data.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TRANSLATORS & INTERPRETERS (95%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (92%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); MACHINE TRANSLATION (89%); MULTILINGUALISM (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); WRITERS (75%); FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT (73%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (72%); STATISTICAL METHOD (69%); LITERATURE (60%)COMPANY: GOOGLE INC (58%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (72%)LOAD-DATE: February 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

DeepMind wrote.??The research team behind AlphaGo will now throw their energy into the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,?? it said.Since its debut last year, AlphaGo??s outstanding performance against human Go masters has offered the public a taste of how AI, when applied to certain settings, can surpass human intelligence.During a series of matches held in Seoul last year, the gaming AI program??s victory against Korean Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol had proved to the public that AI??s implications are imminent and wide.Google is now slated to continue its efforts to apply the key technology behind AlphaGo -- a form of high-level machine learning called deep learning -- to perform difficult tasks in more critical human sectors.Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming.The US tech giant is already engaged in efforts to apply deep learning to the field of medicine. It has been training machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in an eye or cancerous tumors.So far, researchers at Google??s medical imaging team have made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world, according to the company.The tech giant is also working to apply deep learning to cancer diagnostics, developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.However, it will take some time before devices running on Google??s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval, said Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research.For those wondering what will happen to AlphaGo as it officially retreats from competitive play, Google??s DeepMind said it will publish a final academic paper detailing the algorithm??s efficiency and potential for general use later this year.The company said it will also work with Ke Jie to introduce a teaching tool that shows AlphaGo??s analysis of Go positions, providing insights into how the program thinks and giving the public an opportunity to see the game through the eyes of AlphaGo. It has also introduced a special set of AlphaGo vs. AlphaGo games -- the AI learned to play Go by playing millions of games against itself -- that contain ??many new and interesting ideas and strategies,?? according to DeepMind.

"162","Modern poets inspire musical theater -",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"March","Modern poets inspire musical theater -  Korea Times March 29, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesMarch 29, 2017 WednesdayModern poets inspire musical theater -LENGTH: 548 wordsA scene from the musical ""Smoke,"" inspired by Yi Sang's poem ""Ogamdo #15"" / Courtesy of Double K Film & TheaterBy Kwon Mee-yooOn Joo-wan as as poet Yun Dong-ju in the musical 'Yun Dong-ju Shoots the Moon' / Courtesy of Seoul Performing Arts CompanyWhen Korea was under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945), writers expressed their agony over the tragedy of the time and Korean modern literature cannot be explained without an understanding of that era. The spirit of poets who lived through those dark times has inspired modern-day playwrights and musicals centering on the modern poets.Last year, poems of North Korean poet Baek Seok (1912-1996) were revived in the musical ""Me, Natasha and a White Donkey."" Inspired by a woman who loved the poet all her life, the musical beautifully sets Baek's poems to music as if reading a collection of poems. The show was well received by audiences and won the Best Musical, Best Script and Lyrics and Best Direction at the first Korea Musical Awards in January.Following the boom is 'Yun Dong-ju Shoots the Moon' and 'Smoke,' revolving around Yun Dong-ju (1917-1945) and Yi Sang (1910-1937), respectively.""Yun Dong-ju Shoots the Moon,"" produced by the Seoul Performing Arts Company, portrays the poet's agony and literature through music and dance.

These poets are ahead of our time, but their poems still resonate within us. I think these poets remind us of what we have forgotten,"" Kwon said.

"163","Economists versus economy",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Economists versus economy  Korea Times January 4, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesJanuary 4, 2017 WednesdayEconomists versus economyBYLINE: By Robert SkidelskyLENGTH: 1037 wordsLONDON - Let's be honest: no one knows what is happening in the world economy today. Recovery from the collapse of 2008 has been unexpectedly slow. Are we on the road to full health or mired in 'secular stagnation'? Is globalization coming or going?Policymakers don't know what to do. They press the usual (and unusual) levers and nothing happens. Quantitative easing was supposed to bring inflation 'back to target.' It didn't. Fiscal contraction was supposed to restore confidence. It didn't. Earlier this month, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, delivered a speech called 'The Specter of Monetarism.' Of course, monetarism was supposed to save us from the specter of Keynesianism!With virtually no usable macroeconomic tools, the default position is 'structural reform.' But no one agrees on what it entails. Meanwhile, crackpot leaders are stirring discontented voters. Economies, it seems, have escaped from the grasp of those supposed to manage them, with politics in hot pursuit.Before 2008, the experts thought they had things under control. Yes, there was a bubble in the housing market, but it was no worse, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in 2005, than a 'good-sized bump in the road.'So why did they miss the storm? This was exactly the question Queen Elizabeth of Britain asked a group of economists in 2008. Most of them wrung their hands. It was 'a failure of the collective imagination of many bright people,' they explained.But some economists supported a dissenting ? and much more damning ? verdict, one that focused on the failure of economics education. Most economics students are not required to study psychology, philosophy, history, or politics. They are spoon-fed models of the economy, based on unreal assumptions, and tested on their competence in solving mathematical equations. They are never given the mental tools to grasp the whole picture.This takes us back to John Stuart Mill, the great nineteenth-century economist and philosopher, who believed that nobody can be a good economist if he or she is just an economist. To be sure, most academic disciplines have become highly specialized since Mill's day; and, since the collapse of theology, no field of study has aimed to understand the human condition as a whole. But no branch of human inquiry has cut itself off from the whole ? and from the other social sciences ? more than economics.This is not because of its subject matter. On the contrary, the business of earning a living still fills the greater part of our lives and thoughts. Economics ? how markets works, why they sometimes break down, how to estimate the costs of a project properly ? ought to be of interest to most people. In fact, the field repels all but connoisseurs of fanciful formal models.This is not because economics prizes logical argument, which is an essential check on faulty reasoning. The real trouble is that it is cut off from the common understanding of how things work, or should work. Economists claim to make precise what is vague, and are convinced that economics is superior to all other disciplines, because the objectivity of money enables it to measure historical forces exactly, rather than approximately.Not surprisingly, economists' favored image of the economy is that of a machine. The renowned American economist Irving Fisher actually built an elaborate hydraulic machine with pumps and levers, allowing him to demonstrate visually how equilibrium prices in the market adjust in response to changes in supply or demand.If you believe that economies are like machines, you are likely to view economic problems as essentially mathematical problems. The efficient state of the economy, general equilibrium, is a solution to a system of simultaneous equations. Deviations from equilibrium are 'frictions,' mere 'bumps in the road'; barring them, outcomes are pre-determined and optimal. Unfortunately, the frictions that disrupt the machine's smooth operation are human beings. One can understand why economists trained in this way were seduced by financial models that implied that banks had virtually eliminated risk.Good economists have always understood that this method has severe limitations. They use their discipline as a kind of mental hygiene to protect against the grossest errors in thinking. John Maynard Keynes warned his students against trying to 'precise everything away.' There is no formal model in his great book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. He chose to leave the mathematical formalization to others, because he wanted his readers (fellow economists, not the general public) to catch the 'intuition' of what he was saying.Joseph Schumpeter and Friedrich Hayek, the two most famous Austrian economists of the last century, also attacked the view of the economy as a machine. Schumpeter argued that a capitalist economy develops through unceasing destruction of old relationships. For Hayek, the magic of the market is not that it grinds out a system of general equilibrium, but that it coordinates the disparate plans of countless individuals in a world of dispersed knowledge.What unites the great economists, and many other good ones, is a broad education and outlook. This gives them access to many different ways of understanding the economy. The giants of earlier generations knew a lot of things besides economics. Keynes graduated in mathematics, but was steeped in the classics (and studied economics for less than a year before starting to teach it). Schumpeter got his PhD in law; Hayek's were in law and political science, and he also studied philosophy, psychology, and brain anatomy.Today's professional economists, by contrast, have studied almost nothing but economics. They don't even read the classics of their own discipline. Economic history comes, if at all, from data sets. Philosophy, which could teach them about the limits of the economic method, is a closed book. Mathematics, demanding and seductive, has monopolized their mental horizons. The economists are the idiots savants of our time.Robert Skidelsky, a member of the British House of Lords, is professor emeritus of political economy at Warwick University.

They're right to do so -- and not just because China's emergence came as such a big shock to US workers.There used to be a near-universal consensus among academic economists that the best trade policy for any country was to unilaterally remove all barriers and distortions, even if trading partners didn't do the same. As long as distributional issues could be handled -- by helping people who lost jobs to competition -- free trade was seen as a no-brainer.This cozy consensus has been challenged by analyses of trade with China in the 2000s. During previous episodes of globalization, workers displaced by international competition had found new jobs for similar pay. But when trade was opened up with China, a fifth of humanity -- highly productive workers with very low pay -- suddenly entered the labor market. The speed and extent of the resultant hollowing out of US manufacturing appears to have been too much for many workers, who tended to get stuck in lower-paying jobs or on the welfare rolls.Economists thus realized that there was a big problem with free trade that the classical theory hadn't prepared them for: The difficulty of adjusting to huge and sudden changes in the trading system. This should make them consider other ways that the simple Econ 101 theory might not be the whole story. During a recent discussion on the Andreessen Horowitz podcast, I laid out another reason free trade could go awry.There's a theory that cheap labor causes businesses to skimp on investment in labor-saving technology. When there are a whole lot of low-wage workers around, why invest in developing expensive automation or industrial robots, especially if your competitors are just going to copy your innovation eventually? Substituting cheap human hands for expensive research and development can boost profits in the short term, but in the long term it may lead to less innovation.If this theory is right, then the China trade boom of the 2000s might have delayed the push for automation, and thus slowed down productivity growth. In the short term, a surge of cheap human labor looks just like a surge of cheap robot labor, but in the long term, human wages inevitably rise and a lack of innovation undermines further innovation. So some of the slow productivity growth that developed countries are now seeing might be an echo of free trade in the 2000s.But such cases against free trade are limited in two important ways. First of all, they ignore the enormous good that free trade did for the previously impoverished people of China. Second, both cases are fundamentally about the past. Thanks to rising wages, the China shock is now over:And there's little chance that India or Africa, the only comparably populous areas that still have super-low wages, will step in to take China's place anytime soon.So is there still any case to be made against pure unilateral free trade? Perhaps. There's also the possibility that exports raise productivity, and should be encouraged.Economists have long known that exporters tend to be more productive than companies that focus purely on the domestic market. This could be just because high-productivity companies are more likely to compete internationally in the first place. But there is also some evidence that once a company enters world markets, its productivity actually goes up. For example, economists Sourafel Girma, David Greenaway and Richard Kneller found this sort of positive effect for British manufacturing companies. Slovenia and some other developing countries have yielded similar results. Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has argued that exporting helps companies discover what they're good at.If nudging companies to export can raise productivity, the US has work to do. The country's domestic market is so big that lots of companies don't bother to compete globally.So exporting more might help even a high-productivity country such as the US. The same goes for Japan, which despite its legendary export prowess is actually a fairly closed economy.The US currently does some export promotion, via the Export-Import Bank. But this tends to focus on large companies that are already competitive in world markets. A better approach would be to provide assistance for companies to start exporting, by providing them with targeted loans, information about foreign markets and assistance developing overseas sales operations.Also, the US should consider being less tolerant of countries that intervene in markets to keep their currencies cheap versus the dollar -- as China did back in the 2000s. This acts as a subsidy for those countriesï'exporters, but it's also effectively a tax on imports from the US. Getting tougher on currency manipulation could help US companies start selling overseas.So although the China shock is over, there are still some ways in which pure unilateral free trade might not be quite the best policy. Economists, as well as US policy makers, should think more about export promotion.By Noah Smith Noah Smith is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL TRADE (90%); ECONOMICS (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); ROBOTICS (87%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (78%); PRODUCTIVITY (77%); POOR POPULATION (77%); INCOME ASSISTANCE (75%); WELFARE BENEFITS (75%); LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE (75%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (72%); INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION (72%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (70%); PODCASTING (50%)COUNTRY: CHINA (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); INDIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: September 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

The total prize money exceeds 100 million won.This is the first time in the world that the face-lift version of the mega-hit strategy game is broadcast in a professional league, since the game hit shelves last week on the global market.Since the game made its debut, it has swept across the nation, bringing out nostalgia especially among those in their 30s and 40s. The original title achieved unprecedented success here for about two decades after its launch in 1998, serving as a main driver to vitalize the nation's PC game industry.'Reflecting the explosive success of ¡®StarCraft: Brood War' in Korea, we have allocated 100.8 million won for total prize money, a threefold increase from the previous league,' an AfreecaTV official said.'This is the largest of all the StarCraft leagues ever broadcast since 1999.

As president of the academy, I was so proud of the students from different nations who wore gorgeous academic gowns and caps, with big smiles on their faces and certificates of graduation in their hands. During my congratulatory remarks, I asked them to always keep three things in mind wherever they go. I told them, ??First, I want you to build a cultural and literary bridge connecting the world, like the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey. Second, always remember that you are a translator and interpreter between the East and the West, and between Korea and your country. Third, try to become a cultural ambassador of Korea to your nation.??I also told the international students not to forget their professors at the academy even after graduation. I said, ??You could not have had the pleasure and honor of graduating today without the guidance of your professors. In Korea we say, once a teacher, always a teacher. We never refer to our teachers as ??former?? teachers because we believe there is no expiration date for our teachers, mentors and professors. In fact, your teachers are your everlasting milestones and guiding constellations long after graduation.??Finally, I introduced to them the Korean style of friendship that does not care about geographical distance. I told them, ??In English, we say, ??Out of sight, out of mind.?? But Koreans do not seem to abide by the maxim. Once we become friends, our friendship is everlasting, no matter where you are. Actually, Korean folk songs, pop songs and poetry are full of the theme of missing someone who is far away, for example a lover, a friend and a family member.?? I asked the graduating foreign students not to forget their Korean friends as well. I told them, ??I strongly hope that the certificate of graduation will be a constant reminder of your everlasting friendship with Korea, which, I hope, can be your second home and a point of reference to which you return again and again in the future.?? I added, ??Since you can communicate in at least two languages, you have two minds, a dual vision and comparative perspective, which is a blessing. Now you are ready to accomplish what the great American poet Walt Whitman once described as ??a rondure of the world, at last accomplish??d.???? When I had the honor of delivering a speech at the commencement ceremony of the State University of New York at Buffalo a few weeks ago, I urged graduating American students to broaden their horizons so they can hold the world in their arms, embrace ethnic diversity, and accept cultural differences. I said, ??I believe that is the spirit of the humanities, SUNY/Buffalo and the United States!?? I continued, ??I always think of Buffalo, New York as my second hometown because I spent the best years of my life here. Seoul is my primary home to which I constantly return after I travel abroad. But what is a home? A home is a place where you are happy, comfortable, and relaxed. A home is a place where you have family members, relatives and dear friends who care about you. It is a place full of sweet memories of your childhood or adolescence. And it is a place you intensely miss when you are away. If that is the case, then Buffalo is definitely my home.?? Then I urged American students to find their second home elsewhere. ??Even a foreign city or a foreign country can be your second hometown and second homeland.?? Indeed, the new literary movement, Transnationalism, allows loyalty to two countries at the same time these days. I advised graduating American students not to fix their love on one place, but to extend their love to all places, if they want to become a perfect person, a spiritual exile, and a truly global citizen. While addressing the graduating foreign students, I thought about America today that had recently declared, ??America First!?? and ??Make America great again!?? I understand America??s situation fully, and yet I cannot but help noticing there are some contradictions in the two slogans. If you want to be truly great, you are not supposed to say, ??Me first!?? which sounds selfish and childish. To be great is to be generous, diverse and flexible. That is the spirit of America and that is the essence of the American Dream. If America abandons its role of a cross-cultural bridge, interpreter and cultural ambassador, and demanded its allies return the favor monetarily, another country will take its place as the leader of the world. Now I am preaching what I learned from my American professors when America was truly great decades ago. Meanwhile, America seems to be no longer interested in cross-cultural understanding or humanitarian causes. That makes me sad, and yet the original, true American greatness still lives in me as a legacy.

The government has said that middle and high school students will learn Korean history through state-published textbooks starting in 2018, which critics call an attempt to stamp out diverse interpretations of history. / YonhapBy Kim Bo-eunThe education ministry's flip-flops on its plans for history textbooks are fueling confusion.One of the most controversial parts of the state-authored history textbook, the draft of which was unveiled last November, was that it stated Aug. 15, 1948 ? three years after Korea's liberation from Japan's 1910-45 occupation ? as the date for the 'foundation of the nation.'This part remained unchanged in the final version presented Tuesday. Liberal historians protest that this dismisses the importance of independence movements which took place under Japan's colonial rule, as well as the establishment of a provisional government in Shanghai in 1919. They claim the date should be recognized as the day of the Korean government's establishment instead.Along with unveiling the final version of the state-authored textbook, the ministry said it would leave it to private publishers' discretion to choose which view to adopt regarding the date.This is a shift from an earlier stance that it would apply the same guidelines for private publishers' textbooks as it did to the state-authored one.'We revised the guidelines to allow the date to be interpreted as the establishment of the Korean government as a means to respect various opinions on the matter,' Education Vice Minister Lee Young said at a briefing held at the Sejong Government Complex.The finalized state-authored textbook will be used at selected middle and high schools under a pilot project starting in March.However, not many schools are expected to incorporate the books due to opposition from regional education offices.The plan was criticized as an attempt by the Park Geun-hye administration to glorify the achievements of her father, former President Park Chung-hee, a controversial leader whose administration saw profound economic growth but committed many human rights abuses.Out of 17 education offices, 13 have vowed not to cooperate with the ministry in introducing the state-authored books in schools.Even after reflecting 760 proposals for revisions to the draft of the state-authored textbook, the part depicting Park Chung-hee's rule remained mostly the same. The final version added that the movement pushed by the military strongman to develop the country's economy 'received criticism as an attempt to reform people's minds as a means to maintain (Park's) dictatorship.' But the number of pages dedicated to Park's rule remained unchanged.'It was difficult to reduce the section on Park's rule because of the length of his 18-year term,' said Keum Yong-han, an assistant minister at the ministry's school policy office.In November 2015, the ministry had originally planned on changing the system by allowing history textbooks of multiple publishers to only having a single state-authored textbook starting in 2017.However, due to a fierce backlash, the ministry said in December it would allow both state-authored and private publishers' textbooks starting in 2018.In the meantime, it is the ministry's plan for schools to use the state-authored textbook on a voluntary basis, as a pilot project this year.Because private publishers' textbooks based on the revised curriculum are yet to be compiled, schools which do not adopt the state-authored textbook will use existing ones from the private sector.Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers are pushing for a bill which will ban the use of state-authored textbooks.There are also forecasts that the plan for schools to adopt state-authored textbooks, one of President Park's key plans, may end up being discarded because Park is awaiting her impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (95%); HISTORY (91%); PUBLISHING (90%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (89%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (78%); WRITERS (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (77%); DICTATORSHIPS (77%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (77%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (77%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (77%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (77%); SEPARATISM & SECESSION (74%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (73%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (60%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); SHANGHAI, CHINA (55%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); JAPAN (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"170","[Herald Interview] Peering into Korean society with sociological imagination",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"October","[Herald Interview] Peering into Korean society with sociological imagination   THE KOREA HERALD October 26, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 26, 2017 Thursday[Herald Interview] Peering into Korean society with sociological imagination LENGTH: 924 words'Korean Society: An Introduction' by Andrew Eun-gi Kim; Korea University Press (732 pages, $30) For observers of Korean society, including all its idiosyncrasies and mystique, a new book attempts to help interpret the country by offering a sweeping elucidation on crosscutting issues.'Korean Society: An Introduction' is an academic compilation scrutinizing wide-ranging topics, covering ethnological culture, gender politics, family patterns, educational fever, nationalist religion, ageing society, multiculturalism and international marriage, the globalization of Hallyu, urbanization and its discontents, economic history, anti-Americanism and the challenges of reunification and totalitarian mythmaking in North Korea. The book contains a series of articles written by various scholars, and was edited by Andrew Eun-gi Kim, who teaches at the Graduate School of International Studies and Division of International Studies at Korea University in Seoul. Kim, whose research has focused on the sociology of religion, ethnology, popular culture and comparative studies, is a sociologist and graduate of the University of Toronto. Kim illuminates nation-building in South Korea through the lens of 'civil religion,' a term the academic has coined as a framework for analyzing national identity and its concomitant material progress. Kim's assertion centers on the notion that the country during its utilitarian heydays from the 1960s through '80s cultivated, and inculcated, an ideology of national destiny -- to propel and grease the wheels of economic growth. 'The concept of civil religion refers to beliefs, symbols and rituals, as well as institutions, that reinforce social cohesion; legitimatize the socio-political system; and mobilize citizens to the nation's common objectives,ï'Kim writes in the abstract of his article. 'This paper argues that a strong civil religion exists in Korea and that it has been integral to its nation-building process. It also asserts that a succession of authoritarian governments from 1961 through 1993 had promoted civil religion to legitimate and mobilize masses for nationwide modernization and industrialization.ï'If such a blind faith in the nation-state still exists in the Korea of today, it is evidently alive and well among the die-hard bands of ultraconservatives and nationalists. With minds molded in the cauldron of the Saemaul Undong during the period of a 'developmental dictatorship,ï'these individuals wholly embraced and supported the nation's breakneck expansion without regard for minorities or leftists. Now in their 70s and 80s and out of sync with changing social norms, there is an almost religious dimension to their uncritical penchant for everything American, including the Donald Trump administration's 'America Firstï'policies directed at the Korean Peninsula. They publicly express their pugnacious conviction in Korea's own version of 'alt-rightï'populism, as well as deep-seated antagonism toward North Korea. Though tapering off in numbers, they are still a force to be reckoned with in the country's deeply polarized political landscape. In an interview with The Korea Herald earlier this month, Kim claimed that civil, or nationalist, religion is universal, and particularly more pronounced in developing authoritarian societies. He asserted the concept could apply to North Korea, where the obsessive pursuit of nuclear and missile capabilities is constitutionally enshrined and societally extolled.As civil religion spurs both state-building -- of army, infrastructure, schools and hospitals -- and nation-building -- through the indoctrination of national pride and community and a sense of belonging -- Kim's analysis appears consistent with the worrisome developments in North Korea. As for the possibility of grassroots, bottom-up revolution in the hermetically sealed kingdom -- the premise of the 'democratization theoryï'-- Kim surmised that it is unlikely to occur, as the critical mass of well-heeled and well-schooled citizens in North Korea is yet to be found. Kim also offered a healthy dose of criticism on the state of the Korean pop culture industry, which milks profits out of young talents in the absence of authentic artistry and creativity. 'In order for Hallyu to make a lasting impact, it needs to constantly reinvent itself for timeless great music, such as that of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Elton John and Bob Dylan,ï'Kim stressed. 'Korea's music, drama and movie industries should turn their attention to nurturing talented artists who will be remembered across eras instead of churning out pretty boy bands and cutesy girl groups. Art comes first, money and profit come secondary.ï'The scholar mentioned that the Chinese and Japanese governments have also sponsored their popular cultures aggressively on the world stage -- through Confucian Institutes and 'Cool Japanï'campaign, aimed at projecting their soft power. Touching on educational reform, Kim pointed to the need for politicians to push ahead with policies benefitting the whole society, rather than catering to the vested interests of select groups.'The proposal to close down special purpose high schools has been met by strong opposition from conservative groups in education,ï'he said, urging the government not to back down from its original commitment.

But Yun decided to go following Malaysia's revelation last week that VX, a nerve agent considered a chemical weapon, had been employed in killing Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the officials said.Pyongyang, which denies its role in the murder, has not yet introduced its representative to the meeting. Its former Foreign Minister Ri Su-yong had turned up from 2015-2016 to defend international criticism against the North. If the incumbent Minister Ri Yong-ho attends this year's edition, it would mark his debut.The council is predicted to adopt a fresh resolution on the issue as early as Thursday, but it remains unknown whether this year's draft addresses the assassination issue.Yun is also expected to bring up the North's use of VX at the disarmament meeting, while calling for the international community's united front to restrain Pyongyang's growing nuclear program.The oily liquid is known to be one of the most lethal and fast-acting substances in chemical warfare, far stronger than sarin. It is prohibited under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.Malaysian Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said Saturday the chemistry department's findings corroborated the earlier autopsy result that suggested the VX ""caused very serious paralysis"" and led to death ""in a very short period of time.""CCTV footage showed two women rubbed Kim Jong-nam's face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and he was believed to have passed out shortly. He was pronounced dead on his way to a nearby hospital.Following a two-hour check at the airport early Sunday, Malaysian police said they found no traces of any toxin and declared it a ""safe zone.""The authorities assess that several North Koreans including Hyon Kwang-song, a second secretary at its embassy in Malaysia, are implicated in the case, and have arrested one of them. They said Saturday they would issue an arrest warrant for Hyon despite his diplomatic immunity, urging the embassy's cooperation.The arrested man, Ri Jong-chol, is reportedly suspected to have been engaged in the production or acquisition of the chemical agent.The two women -- a Vietnamese and Indonesian -- once again claimed they took part in what they thought was a ""prank"" for a reality show, the two countries' foreign ministries confirmed after respective interviews Saturday.The Malaysian authorities are awaiting an analysis result over ""various chemicals"" seized during a Thursday raid on a condo, which is close to Ri's home and believed to have been rented by four North Korean suspects who fled the country. They are also probing whether the substances were produced locally or brought in from abroad, local news reports said Sunday, citing Selangor police Chief Commissioner Datuk Seri Abdul Samah Mat.In the wake of Kim's assassination, a planned meeting between senior Pyongyang envoy Choe Son-hui and former Washington officials was called off after the US denied a visa for her, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. The two-day talks, which would have been the first contact after US President Donald Trump took office, were scheduled to begin on March 1 in New York.Meanwhile, calls are rising for a re-designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The US blacklisted the country in 1988 after its midair bombing of a Korean Air passenger plane which killed all the 115 aboard, but removed it in 2008 as part of nuclear negotiations.Pyongyang is believed to have 2,500-5,000 tons of chemical weapons, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry's 2016 defense white paper. The regime began its VX production in the 1990s for ""assassination purposes"" by securing related technology and materials from Central Asian nations, Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun reported Saturday, citing a senior-official-turned-defector.In Washington, US Defense Department spokesperson Jeff Davis slammed the North's chemical weapons program Friday, calling it a ""real threat.""""Chemical weapons can be attached to anything -- from a mortar shell or artillery shell to a missile,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News as telling reporters, noting VX is ""not particularly difficult to make.""""We recognize that North Korea has a history of producing and maintaining chemical weapons.""A bipartisan bill calling for the North to be put back on the blacklist has already been proposed to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, the possibility remains slim because it requires meticulous proof for a state's terror-related activities. ã€€The murder and re-designation issues are likely to be raised again during a meeting of the chief nuclear negotiators of South Korea, the US and Japan, set for Monday in Washington.""The re-designation is a step that can be taken by the US, though it is an issue of the international community,"" Seoul's Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam told the National Assembly on Thursday.

'In the second one, we added influences from Eastern Europe and India as well. But we still wanted to feel reminiscence of the first movie, specifically as K is doing investigation going through different layers of time.'That's what I loved about the first 'Blade Runner,ï'it has a relationship with the past even if it's in the future.ï'ã€€ The film features Gosling as Officer K, a new blade runner for the Los Angeles Police Department. ã€€Officer K discovers the truth behind a secret that could throw humanity into chaos. Seeking answers, he sets out to find Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, a former blade runner who has been missing for 30 years. ã€€'You know in this new film, the job of a Blade Runner is different than it was in the original. It's more complicated. It's also much more isolated and Blade Runners are treated like outcasts in the society they live in. They sort of live in the shadows. It's a lonely and harsh existence. The ways he tries to find joy amongst that misery was interesting,ï'said Gosling of his character. ã€€'I am a huge fan of the original film. After I had had the opportunity to read the script and to meet with Denis, as much as I was excited to be part of the legacy of the film, I was very excited to be a part of this original new film, which is rich, complicated, with so many incredible new concepts.ï'ã€€Comparing 'Blade Runner 2019ï'with his previous work, last year's hit musical film 'La La Land,ï'Gosling said, 'I think the difference is that I got punched less (in 'La La Land').'ã€€ Ford reprises the role from 35 years ago. The original 'Blade Runnerï'film was directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. Scott produced Villeneuve's upcoming sequel.ã€€'Well I got a telephone call from Ridley Scott who asked me about four years before I got the script, that there was an idea to create a script for another chapter in the 'Blade Runnerï'story. I was asked if I would be interested, and I said of course, if we had a script that extended the audience's understanding of the character -- that deepened the story.'ã€€ The film is helmed by Canadian director and writer Denis Villeneuve, whose works include last year's sci-fi movie 'Arrival,ï'the crime-thriller 'Sicarioï'(2015) and the thriller 'Prisonersï'(2013).ã€€The 163-minute film is set to premiere in Italy on Oct. 4 and to hit local theaters on Oct. 12.

"177","Celltrion on track to selling worldâ€™s first Rituxan biosimilar in Europe",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"February","Celltrion on track to selling worldâ€™s first Rituxan biosimilar in Europe   THE KOREA HERALD February 22, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDFebruary 22, 2017 WednesdayCelltrion on track to selling worldâ€™s first Rituxan biosimilar in Europe LENGTH: 523 wordsSouth Korean biopharma company Celltrion is on track to commercialize a Rituxan biosimilar for the first time in Europe early next year, marking another major milestone for the drugmaker.The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive recommendation of Celltrion's Truxima, a biosimilar referencing the blockbuster lymphatic cancer drug Rituxan (rituximab) on Friday.In line with the CMPH's recommendation, the EMA is expected to officially grant Truxima marketing and sales approval effective in 31 European countries, as early as February next year, Celltrion said.Celltrion Chairman Suh Jeong-jin (Celltrion)Truxima is Celltrion's second biosimilar to be commercialized in Europe. The Korean drugmaker began selling its Remicade biosimilar in Europe in February 2015 and in the US from November this year.Biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs which have lost patent protection. Multiple companies around the world have been developing biosimilars in line with the approaching patent expiry of some of the world's top-selling biologics.Rituxan, also sold under the name Mabthera, was originally developed by Biogen and is sold globally by US pharmaceutical giant Roche. As of last year, Rituxan was the world's second best-selling biologic drug, having generated worldwide sales of $7.3 billion in 2015.Celltrion plans to file Truxima for review by the US Food and Drug Administration by early next year and become the first company to introduce a Rituxan biosimilar in the US, the world's biggest market for biologic drugs.In addition to Remsima and Truxima, Celltrion has filed another biosimilar drug called Herzuma -- referencing Roche's Herceptin -- for approval by the EMA. The Korean drugmaker plans to seek the US FDA's approval for Herzuma as well.Celltrion holds high expectations for its three biosimilar drugs -- all of which are or will become the first biosimilar versions of their respective originator drugs to enter major markets.""Together, the three originator drugs targeted by our biosimilars account for a global market worth around 25 trillion won ($21.5 billion),"" Celltrion said in a statement.""By selling our products at 30-40 percent discounted prices, we can target a market worth at least 15-17 trillion won. And taking away just 20 percent of this market will amount to sales of more than 3 trillion won within 2-3 years,"" it said.As of June 2016, Celltrion's first biosimilar referencing Remicade -- commercialized in Europe under the name Remsima in February 2015 -- had taken away some 40 percent of the originator drug's sales in the region, the company said.Remsima is expected to generate additional sales in the US, where the biosimilar is sold under the Inflectra name through Celltrion's US partner Pfizer. Celltrion Healthcare, the distribution unit of Cellrion, has stated that it will ship some 260 billion won worth of the drug to the US by the end of the year.""Like the stellar performance shown by Remsima, we expect Truxima to follow a similar sales trajectory across European markets,"" Celltrion said.By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (92%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (91%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (90%); APPROVALS (89%); BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS (78%); US FDA REVIEW (77%); SALES & SELLING (77%); PHARMACEUTICALS PATENTS (77%); CANCER DRUGS (77%); US FDA APPROVALS (76%); CANCER (71%); PATENTS (68%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (65%); LYMPHOMA (56%)COMPANY: BIOGEN IDEC INC (90%); ROCHE HOLDING AG (84%); PFIZER INC (57%)ORGANIZATION: EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (84%); FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION (54%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (90%); ROG (SWX) (84%); PFZ (LSE) (57%); PFE (NYSE) (57%)INDUSTRY: NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (90%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (90%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (90%); NAICS325413 IN-VITRO DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCE MANUFACTURING (84%); NAICS325411 MEDICINAL & BOTANICAL MANUFACTURING (57%); SIC2836 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS, EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES (57%); SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS (57%); SIC2833 MEDICINAL CHEMICALS & BOTANICAL PRODUCTS (57%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); EUROPE (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: February 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"178","Musician launches classical music streaming app",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"May","Musician launches classical music streaming app  Korea Times May 9, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesMay 9, 2017 TuesdayMusician launches classical music streaming appBYLINE: By Park Jin-haiLENGTH: 650 wordsMicky Jung, CEO of the startup Artists' CardMicky Jung, CEO of the startup Artists' Card, recently launched the classical music streaming application, 'Classic Manager.'After winning a government subsidy and establishing the education program, Youth Startup Academy, his company, housed in the Pangyo IT Cluster, made an open-source, membership-free application, where anyone can view compiled data of 23,000 international classical and jazz musicians and live-stream 5,300 classical music albums and 91,000 repertories no longer protected by copyright.The Saint Petersburg Conservatory-educated aspiring composer, who released a number of classical music albums, says his urge to make a difference in the closed world of classical music inspired him to create the application he calls a 'channel.'Classical music streaming application, 'Classic Manager,' launched by Jung 'The Classical industry is a conservative and closed culture, which made the music most difficult to access. Beethoven's music should have been made easier to access than, for instance, K-pop boy band EXO's, but in reality, it is not,' said the 34-year-old entrepreneur. 'People who want to learn to play a Beethoven piece buy the score and a CD, but still they don't know how to begin to learn the piece. The culture _ as if it is made difficult only to allow the few with refined tastes in music who can relish these pieces _ is mostly unchanged since its beginning and this is making the whole industry doomed.'He says K-pop's popularity, now stronger than J-pop, stems from its accessibility and the same should be done for classical music, which has timeless power to move people.'K-pop ascended in the global music industry, riding on the free channel of YouTube. But, the only thing YouTube has done is to provide a platform for the music to reach people. I wanted to make such a channel, connecting music lovers to humanity's musical treasures and enabling anyone to listen and learn classical music, free of barriers. Easier access means more public interest for classical music, which in turn can nurture the whole industry.'In classical music's video streaming service, YouTube comes to mind first, while the International Music Score Library Project for open-source music scores also exists. But, in terms of classical music sources, no business is wielding dominant power and that is where he thought he should preempt the market.Although his company is three months old, the initial response from users is great, with 23,000 people having already downloaded the 'Classic Manager.'Jung, who previously worked for a sound software/hardware company, developed an algorithm which automatically filters music freshly freed from copyrights and adds them to its free archives of music. He says 'Classic Manager' boasts of a vast archive of music thanks to his country-specific filtering and has better sound quality than their European rivals, which mostly service music from old mono records.The musician-turned entrepreneur _ based on local success _ plans to launch the application in Japan this month and in China and Southeast Asian countries later this year.Jung says ultimately he wants to turn it into a classical music multi-library, where users can stream and download music, scores, musician information and academic theses. As he himself was one of many classical musicians who had a hard time trying to make a living in Korea _ his six albums earned him some recognition but didn't make him any richer to say the least _ Jung also plans to help talented young musicians release albums, market them through his application and sell their concert tickets as well.'Everybody says releasing classic albums is a money-losing business. By having a platform where artists can easily release their albums and distribute them, we can change all that so artists can get the biggest share of their own creations,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (92%); MUSIC (91%); CLASSICAL MUSIC (90%); STREAMING MEDIA (90%); EXECUTIVES (90%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (90%); MUSIC INDUSTRY (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (89%); FILM (89%); OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (89%); PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING (85%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (78%); INTERNET BROADCASTING (78%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS (78%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (78%); JAZZ & BLUES (78%); POP & ROCK (78%); INTERNET VIDEO (73%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (73%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (73%); COPYRIGHT (70%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (58%)LOAD-DATE: May 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"179","Blind hiring brings hopes to jobseekers",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Blind hiring brings hopes to jobseekers  Korea Times January 1, 2018 Monday   Korea TimesJanuary 1, 2018 MondayBlind hiring brings hopes to jobseekersBYLINE: By You Soo-sunThe background-blind recruitment, which seeks to hire people based on skills rather than educational background and other credentials, is becoming a source of hope and confidence for many jobseekers.LENGTH: 621 wordsUnder this system, state-run companies are forbidden from asking questions not directly related to the job including the applicants' family background, age, sex and the school they attended on the initial application form. Some private companies have also adopted the practice. This is especially good news for graduates of universities outside of Seoul, who have not been faring so well in the excessively heated job market. 'Now I feel like I can get a job if I just prepare myself well,' Baek Seung-hak, 26, told The Korea Times, Wednesday. A graduate of the Chungnam National University, Baek is among an emerging group of young people seeking to land jobs through the blind recruitment system. As a graduate of a university outside of Seoul, he felt he was at a disadvantage in the job market. The system has brought him hope, as he believes his background will no longer play a critical role. 'Under this new system, I think my chances of getting a job depend on how well I do on the written test and interviews _ so I'm focusing on doing well on those,' he said.Doubts remain about corruptionBut many of his peers, Baek noted, have little faith in the actual process, even as they choose to give it a shot. 'Most of my friends don't trust the blind hiring system. When looking at the people who got jobs at companies, they are mostly from the high-ranking universities based in Seoul. So when my friends fail to pass the first round of the hiring process, they begin to think it's because of their lack of credentials that have led to disappointing results,' he explained. Twenty-five-year-old Yoon Kyung-sik, a senior attending the same university as Baek, also cited some concerns prevalent among his peers, such as the possibility of discrimination against graduates from top-ranking universities, or competition in other ambiguous criteria. Yoon also questioned whether the smaller state-run companies are following the new rules. 'After seeing the news about corruption in the hiring process at some of these companies, my friends and I decided not to apply to smaller state-run companies, assuming they may already have candidates in mind.'Second chance Despite these concerns, Yoon and his friends feel they have a better chance in the job market because of the blind recruitment system.'There's an increasing feeling among my peers that as long as we study and work hard, we can land jobs, at least at state-run companies. It relieves us from the pressure coming from attending a university outside of Seoul,' he said. Yoon believes it also provides him an opportunity to seek a job in an area outside of his major. 'I studied in the department of humanities and arts, but I have been studying by myself to prepare for a different field. The new system allows me to capitalize on the skills I have gained outside of my major.' For some, the system has already provided them with good opportunities. A 28-year-old Kim, a graduate of Chonbuk National University, feels confident about the system which has won him a job at Lotte Cinema this year. 'It was a way to show my authentic self,' Kim said, adding that he was not asked about his credentials during the hiring process. Those recruited through the system had diverse backgrounds and were from different universities ?? from abroad as well as within and outside of Seoul. 'And because the recruiters were not given any typical information, such as university attended, pictures, gender, and even age, they also tried harder to really see through us,' he said. 'It was a difficult process. Within a short span of 10 to 20 minutes, I had to win over the interviewers. Yet, if you are really fit for the position, I believe it is a great chance to show yourself.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EMPLOYMENT (93%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (90%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (89%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (75%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)LOAD-DATE: January 1, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

'The UCR is looking to further strengthen cooperation in these fields with Korean universities and institutions.'Jensen Pennington visited Seoul from Jan. 30 to Feb. 11 to meet the presidents of partner universities and institutions in order to strengthen academic cooperation.The university has formed relationships with more than 100 universities worldwide, 10 of which are in Korea.'Costa Rica is on the verge of becoming a developed country, but it has, as yet, not been successful in sufficiently linking knowledge and production, although our scientific institutions have an adequate potential for contributing in that direction,' Jensen Pennington said.'In this sense, there is a structural gap that we have to fill. We have a well-defined road map, but we still have to work on the conditions of a more productive convergence.'He added that Costa Rica has made much effort to improve the infrastructure of their schools to strengthen their teaching of science and foreign languages.Founded as a public university in Costa Rica, Central America, in 1940, UCR is among the top 10 universities in Latin America.Having six campuses and diverse experimental farms and biological reserves, the UCR has hosted a lot of international scientific conferences.The university ranked 18th among Latin American universities in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings in 2016.'It is without a doubt that UCR is the most important institution of higher education in Central America and the Caribbean. Its reputation is outstanding due to the fact that it is responsible for the highest number of scientific publications and academic citations in its region,' Jensen Pennington said.According to the rector, UCR conducts approximately 60 percent of the scientific projects in Costa Rica, as well as publishing 25 percent of all scientific papers published in Central America.About 42,000 students are enrolled in more than 250 programs from the humanities to medicine, computing and engineering.'Our students actively participate in community outreach activities, which altogether amount to one million hours per year of volunteer work,' the rector said.Expansion of Korean and East Asian studies programsThe university launched the Chair of Korean Studies in 2012 after Laura Chinchilla, former president of UCR, visited Korea.The Korea Foundation and the Academy of Korean Studies have funded the program.The purpose of creating the program is to teach the Korean language and to organize conferences and lectures with visiting Korean scholars on culture, politics, economics and the arts.'Korea is a major world player in many different aspects, and it evolved to this position in a relatively short period of time. This pertains not only to its economic development, but also to its democratic system,' Jensen Pennington said.He stressed that the program has been in high demand, which is why UCR is seeking to restructure itself into a more ample program.'We plan to establish a master's program in Korean studies,' Jensen Pennington said.According to him, the university also plans to expand the existing program to Central America and the Caribbean and to foster cooperation in high-tech fields.'Our academic diplomacy also aims at being a sound basis to promote economic relations.'UCR's other plan is to publish an academic journal about Korean and East Asian studies in Spanish.'The journal will be the first of its kind in the Spanish speaking world,' the rector said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (90%); ENGINEERING (89%); MATH & SCIENCE EDUCATION (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); ASIAN STUDIES (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (73%); ETHNIC & CULTURAL STUDIES (73%); AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH (73%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (72%); VOLUNTEERS (64%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)COUNTRY: COSTA RICA (97%); NORTHERN ASIA (95%); CENTRAL AMERICA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); LATIN AMERICA (90%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (79%); ASIA (73%)LOAD-DATE: February 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Djuna expressed surprise at the public's denial of the movie's intention and the background of sexual assault when the movie came out in 2005. The film critic added that it did not matter so much how one watches the movie, but rather the acknowledgement of the main issue at hand: sexual assault. Many Twitter users agreed with Djuna's perspective and shared the post. According to the film critic, the overall plot of the movie incorporates many similar elements to the Hanssem case. Released in 2005, 'Rules of Datingï'portrays the relationship between English high school teacher Yurim and art teacher-in-training Hong. Throughout the movie, Yurim persistently requests Hong make love to her and she finally succeeds after the two drink together. The plot bears close similarity to what might have happened between the Hanssem employees with the female worker's denial of 'consensual sex,ï'contrary to her supervisor's claims. At the time of the movie's release, the online community fiercely debated whether it was 'rapeï'or 'the beginning of love.ï'Some criticized the movie for its glorification of rape and harassment. 'Rules of Datingï'was co-written by Ko Yoon-hee and director Han Jae-lim for his debut production.

(Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)As a neorealist bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story, Ferrante's novels portray two ""perceptive and intelligent"" girls, Elena Greco and Raffaella Cerullo, as they strive to forge their lives out of a poor, violent and stultifying neighborhood on Naples' outskirts.""The novels neatly fit into the Italian neorealist style, championed by writers Alberto Moravia and Elsa Morante,"" said Italian Ambassador to Korea Marco della Seta at the event. ""The story is universal, depicting Naples, humanity and the friendship and struggle of two women from childhood through adulthood.""Noting that Ferrante is the pen name of the real author, whose identity is cloaked in secrecy, the envoy argued that the novels were successful partly due to Ferrante's mysterious character.

Korea strongly denounces Japan's claim to Dokdo in education guidelines -LENGTH: 433 wordsSouth Korea on Friday strongly denounced Japan's renewed claim to Korea's easternmost islets in its latest education guidelines and demanded their immediate withdrawal.The Japanese government earlier decided to approve the revised guidelines that call for teaching students in elementary and middle schools that Dokdo belongs to Japan.The guidelines, which also serve as a basis for writing textbooks, have been posted online for public viewing since mid-February. They will be added to the elementary school curriculum from 2020 and to the middle school curriculum from 2021.""The government strongly denounces the Japanese government for finally approving the education guidelines for its elementary and middle school social studies that include its unjustified claims to our inherent territory of Dokdo despite our repeated warnings,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""And we demand its immediate withdrawal""""We warn Japan to bear in mind that if it pushes again to inject inaccurate historical perceptions following the wrongful claims to Dokdo, which was the first victim of Japan's imperialism, in its newly authorized textbooks, its next generations will learn false history,"" it added.The ministry plans to call in a Japanese embassy official to lodge an official protest.Dokdo, a set of rocky islets lying closer to the Korean Peninsula in the East Sea, has long been a recurring source of tension between the neighbors. South Korea has kept a small police detachment on Dokdo since its liberation from Japan in 1945 and has made clear that Tokyo's claims are utterly groundless.Last week, the Japanese education ministry announced the list of its newly authorized textbooks to be used from April next year for high school sophomores.Of the 24 newly approved social studies textbooks, 19, or nearly 80 percent, claim that Dokdo is Japanese territory. Some state that South Korea is illegally occupying Dokdo, called Takeshima, in Japan.Japan's repeated claims to the South Korean territory is expected to worsen the frayed diplomatic relations between the two neighbors as they have been at odds for months over a recently-erected girl statue that symbolizes Tokyo's wartime sexual slavery of Korean women.Japan has been demanding the removal of the statue installed in front of its consulate in the southern port city of Busan, saying that it is in violation of the spirit of the deal reached in late 2015 between the two neighbors to resolve the rift over the issue ""once and for all.""

"187","Tongyeong celebrates native sonâ€™s music",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"April","Tongyeong celebrates native sonâ€™s music   THE KOREA HERALD April 2, 2017 Sunday   THE KOREA HERALDApril 2, 2017 SundayTongyeong celebrates native sonâ€™s music LENGTH: 787 wordsTONGYEONG, South Gyeongsang Province -- The sound of a lone cello struggling against the orchestra opened this year's Tongyeong International Music Festival in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, Friday.German-French cellist Nicolas Altstaedt and the Tongyeong Festival Orchestra led by Stefan Soltesz performed Yun I-sang's Cello Concerto written in 1976. The Korean-born composer was abducted from Germany by Korean agents in 1967 and handed a lifetime sentence on a charge of treason. He was imprisoned for two years before the Korean government freed him, bowing to international pressure. This experience would have profound influence on his later work.Cello Concerto is autobiographical. The cello, an instrument which Yun played, tells the composer's narrative. The cello is not in harmony with the orchestra; rather, it is in isolation from it, struggling against the orchestra. In this description of the piece, one can see Yun's personal struggles as a Korean composer in Europe composing Western music. One can also see the struggles of an individual against the state.The Tongyeong Festival Orchestra, led by Stefan Soltesz and cellist Nicolas Altstaedt, performs Yun I-sang's Cello Concert Friday at Tongyeong Concert Hall in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. (TIMF)Yun, Korea's best known composer in the West, is credited with bridging the East and the West. And his efforts to bring Korean elements into Western classical music tradition is clearly seen in Cello Concerto. The cello strings are struck and picked, producing a sound akin to that produced by geomungo, the traditional Korean six-string zither. Sounds of moktak, a wooden percussion instrument associated with Buddhist monks, bring meditative moments to the largely dissonant single-movement concerto.Beethoven Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, more popularly known as the ""Choral,"" followed Yun's Cello Concerto. While this massive choral piece is very well-known today and many music critics consider it one of the greatest works by Beethoven, its premiere in 1824 was not nearly as successful -- many critics thought the aging and deaf composer had completely lost it.Set to the poem by Friedrich Schiller, ""Ode to Joy,"" the choral part of the symphony speaks of the prospects of a hopeful future achieved by brotherhood of mankind, mankind's progress toward utopia.Friday night's programming, juxtaposing a contemporary piece that pits and individual against the world with a work that proclaims brotherhood of humanity, seems deliberate, providing a message of hope and reconciliation. At another level, the program showed how a once much criticized piece came to be universally appreciated; perhaps an expression of hope that Yun's work will one day be appreciated for the music, freed from the controversies surrounding the composer.Yun was not allowed to return to Korea in his lifetime after he went back to Germany and his music has seldom been perform in the country of his birth. As Yun's work is mostly European avant-garde, those unfamiliar with contemporary classical music may find Yun's work difficult to understand or appreciate at the first try. Although he features many Korean musical elements, including using Western musical instruments in such ways to make them sound Korean, they do not sound Korean to untrained ears.""Loyang"" (1962), performed on Saturday by the Isang Yun Soloists Berlin, for example features bak, a traditional Korean percussion instrument and incorporates many elements of Asian music. However, it is essentially a Western contemporary music and recalling traditional Korean music in that piece is a futile exercise.The Isang Yun Soloists Berlin - originally composed of members who hail from the International Isang Yun Society and the Isang Yun Ensemble Berlin - also performed Yun's Trio for Clarinet, Bassoon and Horn (1992) and ""Piece concertante"" (1976) on Saturday afternoon. Flutist Roswitha Staege and oboist Ingo Goritzki of the Isang Yun Soloists Berlin have been performing Yun's music for decades.This year, Koreans will have more opportunities to hear Yun's work being performed, as the year marks the centennial of the composer's birth. Tongyeong International Music Festival, which does not bear Yun's name in its title although one of its goals is to commemorate the musical legacy of the composer, for example, will be featuring one or two works by Yun in each of the concert programs.The festival comes to a close on April 9 with the Seoul Philharmonic led by Dennis Russell Davies performing ""Short Ride in a Fast Machine,"" from John Adams, Yun's ""Fanfare and Memorial"" and Clarinet Concerto and Stravinsky's ""Le Sacre du Printemps.""By Kim Hoo-ran(khooran@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: STRINGED INSTRUMENTS (94%); MUSIC (92%); CLASSICAL MUSIC (91%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (90%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (90%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (90%); FESTIVALS (90%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (90%); MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS (90%); ORCHESTRAS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); MUSIC REVIEWS (78%); POETRY (76%); PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS (73%); KIDNAPPING & ABDUCTION (71%); TREASON (71%); PROFILES & BIOGRAPHIES (71%); BUDDHISTS & BUDDHISM (63%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS (50%); RELIGION (50%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); GERMANY (90%); EUROPE (72%)LOAD-DATE: April 2, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Under their joint venture agreement, Biogen can exercise a call option effective until the end of 2018 to expand its stake in Bioepis to 49.9 percent.Bioepis took on affiliate status after it underwent an audit to determine its market value and the costs that BioLogics would have to shoulder in case Biogen exercised its call option.According to BioLogics, the rise in Bioepis' market value raised the likelihood of Biogen exercising its call option, which would weaken BioLogics' ownership of Bioepis. It was thereby under such circumstances that Bioepis took on affiliate status.Samsung BioLogics' net profit reported in 2015, was therefore calculated based on the change in its relationship to Samsung Bioepis, the company said. From 2016, Bioepis' performance is no longer included in BioLogics' accounting records.""If the FSS decides to carry out the special audit, we will fully cooperate with the authorities in accordance with law. We hope that this investigation will clear up all misunderstandings about our accounting practices,"" Samsung BioLogics said.By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ACCOUNTING (93%); AUDITS (91%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (90%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (90%); COMPANY EARNINGS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); COMPANY PROFITS (89%); SECURITIES TRADING (87%); ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (78%); ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS (78%); BANKING & FINANCE AGENCIES (77%); AGREEMENTS (77%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (70%); JOINT VENTURES (69%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (84%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (84%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (84%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (84%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (84%)CITY: INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: April 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

More or less, playing by the rules often left us defeated, cheated or behind.As we step into the ""real world,"" we grow to learn that being nice can actually get us nowhere.It seems more so these days that the world is surrounded and led by those that, based on our juvenile standards, would be closer to wolves than lambs.A divisive businessman -- touting authoritarian populism that goes against the humanity, liberal democracy and global capitalism that modern societies have considered sacred values -- has been elected to a seat that can move and shake the entire world order.A relentless politician -- bracing to challenge constitutionalism while tuning out historical truths of imperialistic atrocities -- is on course to become his country's longest-serving postwar premier.At home, a ham-fisted affair of plutocracy between political and economic leaders has thrown the country into months of lethargy, with their prerogatives still defended by many for having led profit and growth.What indeed appears to be fundamentally futile is the fact that all of this is being done under the umbrella of democracy, a value that has been pulling the world along for decades and disciplining those who dare sidestep moral norms.Having pursued the noble values that held us grounded at times we were personally tested, we are indeed seen to be entering a time of doubt, questioning whether what we have believed to be the utmost truth since our childhood warrants any further devotion.There is also this nagging voice inside that makes us hesitate to define our own as being truly altruistic, whether we are innocent enough to throw unbridled criticisms, and whether we are truly free of guilt in our meager ordinary lives.The sentiment was well illustrated by Al Gini, professor of business ethics at Loyola University in Chicago, who said in his previous book that the most glaring example of academic oxymoron are the terms ""business ethics"" and ""moral leadership.""As businesses operate under the ""dictum of legal moralism,"" he wrote that everything is allowed that is not strictly forbidden.He went on to explain, citing surveys, that workers are as ethical and dutiful in doing their jobs as their bosses and companies are perceived to be ethical.But a business, although it reaps profit through products, is inevitably a people's business, reliant on relations, as it cannot be an isolated entity that is unaffected by the demands of individuals and society, he added.These pretty much sum up the task we have at hand, as we are placed in a dilemma between tackling ethical lapses and the sense of survival to continue on with our economic fulfillment.But it is because of that, that we must turn to the last bastion of restraint as we wade through the time of extremes.Although democracy and capitalism seem to pale in the face of declining egalitarian prosperity, it is the best we have.The rule of law has provided the yardsticks for democratic capitalism, and legality must remain unwavering from self-interest or even public sentiment.Legal interpretation and application should be tight, equal and powerful, and in order to achieve that, it should be respected and upheld at all times.It is also because of this, that we demand those in any type of power to operate under the potency of virtues, for without followers they would have nothing to lead.It is not just to play nice, but to avoid co-destruction, at the least for sake of our next generation growing up to the same folk tales of the good disarming the evil.By Lee Joo-heeLee Joo-hee is the business desk editor of The Korea Herald.

As technology advances, design is playing a key role in emergence of new industries and convergence of existing ones. In an era emphasizing comprehensive thinking skills, creative perspectives and empathy, the role of design and the human elements becomes even more prominent.Under the theme of 'Design for Humanity,' Herald Design Forum 2017 will bring together design gurus from across the world to share their knowledge and experience about sustainable design for humanity and the world.The annual forum will take place at Hotel Shilla in Jangchung-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. It is hosted by Herald Corporation and sponsored by Seoul Metropolitan Government, Design Korea and Organica.The star-studded list of speakers includes: Jaime Hayon, industrial designer and head of Hayon Studio; Claudio Francesco Bellini, CEO and founder of Claudio Bellini Design+Design; Naoto Fukasawa, product designer and head of Naoto Fukasawa Design; Carme Pigem, architect and co-founder of RCR Arquitectes; Seok Yong-bae, shoe design director and CEO of Seok; Aernout Dijkstra-Hellinga, design director of Bugaboo International; George Popescu, CEO and co-founder of Lampix; and Gen Terao, founder and CEO of Balmuda Inc.These leading minds in the design world will discuss the future of design.'I think individuals with a strong sense of identity, who have something more to bring to the table aside from function, will be leading the design industry,' Hayon told The Korea Herald in an interview. 'The evolution of the way we live our lives requires objects to transmit emotions and make us feel.'He will speak about how a designer's imagination can prompt people to dream of a better world. Following him leading Italian designer and architect Bellini will talk on designs crossing boundaries, and Fukusawa will lead a session about the essence of design found in our daily lives.The messages will be part of the forum's first session, 'Design for Humanity,ï'through which design masters hope to bring changes to the world.The second and third sessions will take place in the afternoon; session 2, 'Design Thinking,ï'is about solving issues imposed in this day and age by empirical design thinking. Session 3, 'Design 4.0,ï'is about how design will lead changes in the future. Each session will be followed by a 30 minute panel discussion.Bellini, Baek, Popescu and Sung will partake in the Herald Design Premium Talk from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., which will allow participants a chance to freely share ideas with the speakers and network with one another. Since the inaugural Herald Design Forum in 2011, under the theme of 'Design Changes the World,ï'the event has presented questions to the rest of the world on how to tap into infinite potential of design and maximize its values.

"192",NA,NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"November","Humanity as Australian aborigines  Korea Times November 8, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesNovember 8, 2017 WednesdayHumanity as Australian aboriginesBYLINE: By Lyman McLallenLENGTH: 736 wordsLyman McLallenSchools and colleges everywhere constantly strive to create good curricula so they can endow their students with the best opportunities to study and develop themselves to become valuable citizens. Ideally, teachers lead students along the curriculum but not too fast because it takes patience, diligence and unquenchable curiosity to study what is worth knowing.Good schools and colleges enable teachers to cultivate students and help them become enthusiastic about their studies. With a well thought-out curriculum teachers learn more than they teach and students master what they never dreamed they could. Good curricula lead both students and teachers to want to study and do more.In the first chapter of Teaching as a Conserving Activity, Neil Postman writes that an education philosophy should inspire a curriculum that will 'produce the kind of people needed to live effectively within the conditions of their culture.'Showing that an education philosophy should also inspire a curriculum that would teach people to anticipate changes in the conditions of their culture, Postman describes the fate of the Australian Aborigines. The Aborigines 'effectively lived within the conditions of their culture' for more than 20,000 years. In the time they lived undisturbed by the outside world, their curriculum - the initiation of their young into their ways of knowing and working within their world - served them well.Their culture, remarkably, had remained pristine all that time, but then came the incursion of British settlers who, bringing 18th Century science and technology with them, changed Australia beyond anything the Aborigines could recognize.Had the Aborigines been invaded from outer space, which in a sense they were, it couldn't have been worse for them. The invading aliens - mostly petty law-breakers the British cleared from their prisons - put new pressures on the Aborigines as they tried to make sense of the changing world around them.In this new condition brought from beyond, the Aborigines could no longer sustain themselves with their pre-Neolithic oral culture and its ways of knowing the world that so ably served them through the millennia they enjoyed undisturbed by outside forces.To overcome their crisis with the mechanical world the new arrivals built in their native land, the Aborigines were faced with doing one of two things: either they would have to examine their ways of perceiving the world so they could maintain their cultural continuity, or they would have to give up their culture and embrace that of the invading settlers.So far, they have been able to do neither and have yet to find a way out of their social dysfunction brought on by the inadequacies of their ancient curriculum, and they're the poorer for it.Today, all of us find ourselves in a similar fix as the Aborigines found themselves in. Though we are in no danger of being invaded from outer space as Australia was invaded by the British, we are living in a completely transformed and continuously changing world wrought by our own creations.Like the Aborigines, we too are in need of examining our education philosophy and rethinking and reshaping our curricula so we can teach our children how they can live effectively in this era of profound change.From its beginning, the industrial world has constantly been changing. With the unceasing proliferation of new inventions and applications of new technology happening now, how we live and what we must do so we can continue to live well is changing rapidly.In our era, more changes occur in a year than occurred for the Aborigines during the whole of their undisturbed millennia. The need for new curricula and different ways of knowing - not just so we can survive but so we may be able to live the best lives possible for us to live - is crucial.In the 1890s, American scholar John Dewey observed in one of his lectures that the best education for all is the education the wisest and best parents want for their children. This is a broad prescription and to us in 2017 may seem ancient, but it is still a good place to start. What we must determine, and then consider carefully, is who these best and wisest parents are, and what makes them so?McLallen taught at Korea University and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

'And for me it was inspired more by things like Bong Joon-ho's The Host or Kim Jee-woon's The Good, the Bad, the Weird, which sort of take traditional ideas and Western ideas and twist them and make them new.'So looking at movies like The Host and The Good, the Bad, The Weird, that was a jumping-off point for me of how to potentially make a new King Kong movie feel fresh.'The American director said the 30-meter-tall King Kong that appears very early in the film is an example of the Korean movies' influence on his film. He said he took the idea from 'The Host' as Bong shows his monster at the beginning of the film, and that he hates monsters appearing at the end of the movie.The influence of Kim's film on the King Kong movie is also found in the movie. He said the tone and genre of the film switches from one to another frequently to express serious and violent scenes while inserting comic relief in between.'The first clip on the beach, one thing for me that was very inspired by Korean cinema is the way that you guys are able to take tone and different genres to jump between them very quickly. American filmmakers and a lot of Americans audiences are uncomfortable with big shifts in tone and big shifts in genre,' the director said.'I am so in love with what Korean directors are able to do by jumping between two different genres and jumping between different tones very seamlessly, and together making something that becomes sort of poignant because of that.'That was a bit of a jumping-off point for me in how to approach a scene like that: you can have these funny goofy moments that are absurd and have these moments that are very serious, very dark and very violent.'Vogt-Roberts also referred to the monstrous creature in 'The Host' as an inspiration behind his Skull Crawler. He explained that his monster and that of Bong's walk in a similar manner in that they both walk very uncomfortably as if they have evolved wrong and keep stumbling.The director hinted that King Kong will not go to New York City and he will not end the film with another 'Beauty and the Beast' moment, because there are already enough of those.Instead, he said he wants to emphasize that people have become arrogant that they can control the world, but there is always a more powerful force than humanity. In that sense, King Kong is somewhere between a man and a god, and Vogt-Roberts wants to show how small humans can look in front of the monstrous creatures of the isolated island.'Kong: Skull Island' hits theaters March 9.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HORROR FILMS (90%); FILM GENRES (89%); FILM DIRECTORS (78%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (78%); MEDIA VIOLENCE (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); VISUAL ARTISTS (73%); DRAMA FILMS (73%); VIETNAM WAR (54%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); NORTHERN ASIA (88%)LOAD-DATE: February 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Beethoven's music should have been made easier to access than, for instance, K-pop boy band EXO's, but in reality, it is not,' said the 34-year-old entrepreneur. 'People who want to learn to play a Beethoven piece buy the score and a CD, but still they don't know how to begin to learn the piece. The culture _ as if it is made difficult only to allow the few with refined tastes in music who can relish these pieces _ is mostly unchanged since its beginning and this is making the whole industry doomed.'He says K-pop's popularity, now stronger than J-pop, stems from its accessibility and the same should be done for classical music, which has timeless power to move people.'K-pop ascended in the global music industry, riding on the free channel of YouTube. But, the only thing YouTube has done is to provide a platform for the music to reach people. I wanted to make such a channel, connecting music lovers to humanity's musical treasures and enabling anyone to listen and learn classical music, free of barriers. Easier access means more public interest for classical music, which in turn can nurture the whole industry.'In classical music's video streaming service, YouTube comes to mind first, while the International Music Score Library Project for open-source music scores also exists. But, in terms of classical music sources, no business is wielding dominant power and that is where he thought he should preempt the market.Although his company is three months old, the initial response from users is great, with 23,000 people having already downloaded the 'Classic Manager.'Jung, who previously worked for a sound software/hardware company, developed an algorithm which automatically filters music freshly freed from copyrights and adds them to its free archives of music. He says 'Classic Manager' boasts of a vast archive of music thanks to his country-specific filtering and has better sound quality than their European rivals, which mostly service music from old mono records.The musician-turned entrepreneur _ based on local success _ plans to launch the application in Japan this month and in China and Southeast Asian countries later this year.Jung says ultimately he wants to turn it into a classical music multi-library, where users can stream and download music, scores, musician information and academic theses. As he himself was one of many classical musicians who had a hard time trying to make a living in Korea _ his six albums earned him some recognition but didn't make him any richer to say the least _ Jung also plans to help talented young musicians release albums, market them through his application and sell their concert tickets as well.'Everybody says releasing classic albums is a money-losing business. By having a platform where artists can easily release their albums and distribute them, we can change all that so artists can get the biggest share of their own creations,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (92%); MUSIC (91%); CLASSICAL MUSIC (90%); STREAMING MEDIA (90%); EXECUTIVES (90%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (90%); MUSIC INDUSTRY (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (89%); FILM (89%); OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (89%); PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING (85%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (78%); INTERNET BROADCASTING (78%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS (78%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (78%); JAZZ & BLUES (78%); POP & ROCK (78%); INTERNET VIDEO (73%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (73%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (73%); COPYRIGHT (70%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (58%)LOAD-DATE: May 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

(Yonhap)""I think it is certain that the North Korean regime is behind the incident,"" said Hwang, referring to the Malaysian police's investigation results that showed more than five North Korean citizens were involved in the attack.""The incident is a criminal act of terrorism against humanity and we will never tolerate this. It demonstrates the reckless and brutal nature of the North Korean regime that uses whatever means possible to stay in power,"" he added.ã€€The remark came a day after the Malaysian police announced they are searching for four more North Koreans in connection with the killing of Kim Jong-nam. The suspects have reportedly returned to Pyongyang after leaving Malaysia on the same day Kim died.Later in the day, North Korea's Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol said he could not trust the Malaysian police investigation, calling for a joint probe into the murder case, which has caused a diplomatic row between the two nations.In a rare comment to reporters, the ambassador repeated the claim that the Malaysian government is ""conspiring"" with South Korea to distract from the case of President Park Geun-hye, who is suspended from power after being impeached for a bribery scandal.""It has been seven days since the incident, but there is no clear evidence on the cause of death and at the moment we cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police,"" Kang said.Kang made the comment after being summoned by the Malaysian Foreign Ministry over a similar allegation he made against the probe into the murder case. On Friday, he accused the government of ""colluding with hostile forces"" to perform the autopsy -- despite his objection -- on the body believed to be Kim Jong-nam.In response, the foreign ministry dismissed the ambassador's claim as ""baseless"" and vowed to proceed with the investigation under Malaysian law. The autopsy result is scheduled to be announced Wednesday, according to the Malaysian police.""The Malaysian Government has been transparent. The (North Korean) Embassy has been kept informed of developments related to the matter as well as the processes involved under Malaysian law,"" the ministry said in a statement.South Korea's Defense Minister Han Min-koo, meanwhile, said that the murder of Kim Jong-nam, who had been critical of his younger brother's power succession, is part of Pyongyang's attempts to remove potential challengers to leader Kim Jong-un's dictatorial power.During his meeting with lawmakers Monday, the minister also noted the alleged assassination of the elder Kim would deliver a ""stern warning"" to North Korean defectors and dissenters living inside the Stalinist regime.""I think it will remove alternative forces to the Kim Jong-un regime and warn the international community against any possible regime change attempts,"" Defense Minister Han Min-koo was quoted as saying by Rep. Kim Young-woo of the Bareun Party, who chairs the National Assembly's National Defense Committee.The attendants also discussed a plan to demand the United Sates put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, according to lawmaker Kim.

Human Rights Council's session in Geneva on Tuesday, adding many countries are not cooperating with his office.Zeid criticized North Korea for rejecting the council's resolutions on the appointment of the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea and repeatedly turning down visits to the North by the special rapporteur.U.N. human rights experts, including U.N. Special Rapporteur on North Korea Tomas Ojea Quintana and his predecessor Marzuki Darusman, had arranged for visits to the North to investigate alleged crimes against humanity in the country, but they were not able to do so due to the North's objection.The report also said Zeid welcomed the North's agreement last month to a visit by a U.N. human rights expert for the first time ever. North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un allowed Catalina Devandas-Aguilar, the special rapporteur on the rights of people with disabilities, to visit Pyongyang and South Hwanghae Province.Considering the human rights situation in the North, Zeid said the visit to the North by the special rapporteur on the rights of people with disabilities doesn't make up for North Korea's lack of cooperation with the U.N. special rapporteur on North Korea, his office and the U.N. office on North Korea's human rights in South Korea.

Moon's offer appears intended to improve strained inter-Korean relations through sports exchanges.Moon made the proposal during the opening ceremony of the World Taekwondo Championships in Muju, North Jeolla Province, Saturday. 'If North Korean athletes participate in the Olympics, it would greatly contribute to realizing Olympic values, which are about bringing humanity together and promoting world peace,"" he said. Moon added his government would do whatever it can for that goal.North Korea's sole International Olympic Committee member Chang Ung attended the opening ceremony. A 36-member North Korean team also performed a taekwondo demonstration Saturday.Despite the liberal President's proposal, it is difficult to expect Seoul and Pyongyang to agree on a united team easily. During Saturday's dinner reception, Chang expressed skepticism about a joint Korean team, saying time was pressing.Talks on a unified team could also falter because there is a big gap in skills between winter sports athletes from the two Koreas. The North didn't send an athlete to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and not a single North Korean has qualified for the PyeongChang Olympics.Given the strengthening sanctions against the reclusive state, there are concerns that Moon's proposal might make a hole in the international community's coordinated moves. The United States could also misunderstand Moon's offer ahead of this week's summit meeting.True, exchanges in sports seem easy and simple, compared to those in other areas. In 1991, the two Koreas sent unified teams to the world table tennis and youth football championships. Their athletes also marched together during the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics.Given these facts, forming a joint team is not necessarily impossible, although just seven months are left. One can also expect sports exchanges to serve to ease military tensions here.The problem is that Moon's impatience for dialogue might result in weakening our bargaining power at a time when North Korea's young dictator Kim Jong-un is accelerating his country's nuclear and missile programs.

Korea Centre. The conference, which brought together 50 writers from all over the world, including both Korean-heritage and non-heritage writers, turned out to be a huge success. At the meeting I met professor Kim Jong-hoe who is an expert on Korean Diaspora. Professor Kim has been traveling to many countries on behalf of Kyung Hee University to award the KU literary prize to outstanding overseas writers who write in Korean. He told me that those writing in Korean in foreign countries, who are quite old now, will disappear in the near future as the first-generation immigrants will die out. It made me sad to realize that all those invaluable diasporic experiences written by them in Korean will be buried in oblivion. Undoubtedly, the second and third generation immigrants will no longer be interested in their parentsï'diasporic writings written in Korean.Today, more than 7 million Koreans are residing outside of Korea as immigrants. Scattered all over the world, they disseminate Korean culture on the one hand and assimilate with foreign culture on the other. In the United States, for example, there are reportedly 1.5 million Korean Americans currently in residence. These numbers have been increasing dramatically over the past century, since the first Korean immigration to Hawaii in January 1903. The diasporic experiences of those who immigrated to the United States and elsewhere have been faithfully reflected and recorded in numerous works of fiction, poetry and essays written by them. In the introduction to a book, 'Diaspora in Korean (Immigrant) Literature,ï'professor So-hee Lee and I write in the preface that the term 'diasporaï'originally refers to the state of exile of dispersed Jewish peoples and the religious and cultural affiliations they uphold despite geographical distances. We also argue that with increased population mobility and widespread information, 'diasporaï'has acquired a broader meaning lately. Recent literary and cultural studies have determined that the reinterpretation of ethnicity, nationality and globalization has increased the number of social formations that might be labeled as diasporic. Therefore, the term can be nicely applied to Korean immigrants who are closely connected by a network of family ties, morality, manners, and cultural traditions to their homeland. However, this sense of cultural belonging may produce certain undesirable side-effects, such as 'strong nostalgic and separatist tendencies.ï'This tendency is especially manifest in Korean immigrants who are instinctively inclined to their homeland and thus become nostalgic wherever they go. That is why scholars of diaspora propose that the term 'diasporaï'be interpreted as something referring to a sense of displacement in a host country rather than to nostalgia for an actual homeland. More recently, scholars have argued that diaspora can also be used loosely to describe a kind of 'dispersed intellectual formation.ï'In other words, diaspora includes in its definition the spiritual exile of uprooted, displaced writers or intellectuals living in a postcolonial situation who search for a cultural identity while immersed within a hybrid cultural environment where their indigenous cultures are invariably marginalized and suppressed. When we discussed diaspora in the past, our concern was limited to Korean-American, Korean-Russian or Korean-Japanese writers who write in their host countriesï'language. These days, however, our concern has been drastically expanded to the Korean immigrants who write in Korean on foreign soil. It might be a good idea, therefore, to record and preserve their diasporic experiences because they were not only a valuable cultural text but also an important social document. Some time ago, professor emeritus Young-Key Kim-Renaud at George Washington University sent me a copy of the literary magazine published in Korean by the Korean Americans in Washington, DC. Reading it, I was deeply moved by the superb rendition of their diasporic experiences. I also met a number of Korean writers writing in Korean in Los Angeles, who were so enthusiastic about and proud of their literary activities. Their main concern was how to render the compelling issues of immigrants such as how to mediate the irreducible chasm between their indigenous cultural identity and the dominant culture, into which they have to assimilate and acculturate.There is some encouraging news. Currently, professor Park Duk-kyu is administering a series of summer lectures for the Korean communities in LA on behalf of Dankuk University. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, too, has recently launched a project designed to support the immigrant writers who write in Korean overseas. Indeed, it is a high time that we encouraged and supported Korean immigrant writers who write in Korean overseas. The new literary movement, 'transnationalism,ï'allows immigrants to be loyal not only to their host country but also to their home country. If so, supporting their diasporic writings will surely strengthen the spiritual ties between the Koreans and the Korean immigrants overseas.

"202","Samsung Bioepis' biosimilar hits $100 mil. sales in Europe",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Samsung Bioepis' biosimilar hits $100 mil. sales in Europe  Korea Times January 31, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesJanuary 31, 2017 TuesdaySamsung Bioepis' biosimilar hits $100 mil. sales in EuropeBYLINE: By Yoon Sung-won Samsung Bioepis is accelerating business in Europe on solid sales of its first biosimilar medicine 'Benepali,' according to the pharmaceutical industry Tuesday.LENGTH: 477 wordsIn its recent regulatory filing, U.S. pharmaceutical enterprise Biogen said it posted $100.6 million in sales of Benepali in the European market last year. In the first three quarters of 2016, cumulative sales from Benepali remained at $47.9 million.But the number has skyrocketed to over $50 million in the fourth quarter alone, according to Biogen. As one of Samsung Bioepis' shareholders with a 6.7 percent stake, Biogen is distributing the Korean company's biosimilar medicines in Europe. Samsung BioLogics holds 93.3 percent stake of Samsung Bioepis as of the end of last year.'Benepali is showing solid growth in Europe,' Biogen said.Samsung Bioepis expected that the better-than-expected sales performance of its biosimilar products will help it turn to a profit. The company posted 100.2 billion won in operating losses in 2016, compared to the previous year's 161.1 billion won deficit. Its annual sales reached 147.5 billion won last year.'(Benepali) is showing faster sales growth as time goes on,' a Samsung Bioepis official said. 'We expect that our financial status will improve following sales expansion.'The biosimilar business affiliate of Samsung Group has developed Benepali based on the multinational pharmaceutical firm Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis medicine named 'Enbrel.' Enbrel brought in about $2.5 billion in Europe in 2014.In January 2016, Samsung Bioepis acquired approval from the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to release Benepali in the region. It was the first time for an Enbrel copycat to be cleared for sale in Europe. The biosimilar has since been distributed not only in Korea but also in Europe.Based on the rapid growth in Europe, Samsung Bioepis and Biogen plan to speed up penetration into the region, by expanding distribution networks of Benepali to Eastern Europe.Biogen also aims to boost sale of another biosimilar 'Flixabi' in the market. Flixabi has been developed by Samsung Bioepis based on Janssen Pharmaceutical's autoimmune disease medicine 'Remicade,' which is also known as 'Infliximab.'Flixabi was cleared to be sold in Europe in May last year and has been released in the region since the third quarter last year. But the sales from Flixabi have settled at about $100,000.Biogen has recently signed an agreement with the Swiss-based medicine distributor Ewopharma to sell Benepali and Flixabi in six EU member nations including Romania, Croatia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Established as a joint venture of Samsung BioLogics and Biogen in 2012, Samsung Bioepis has also worked with chemical industry giant Merck to develop biosmilar medicines based on AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis medicine 'Humira' and Roche's breast cancer medicine 'Herceptin.' In 2013, the two companies have agreed that Merck can distribute Benepali globally except for in the United States, Japan and the European Union.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: SALES & SELLING (90%); SALES FIGURES (90%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); RHEUMATIC DISEASES (87%); ARTHRITIS (87%); PHARMACEUTICALS TRADE (78%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (78%); FINANCIAL RESULTS (78%); CANCER DRUGS (78%); CANCER (78%); SALES PROJECTIONS (77%); JOINT VENTURES (76%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (75%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (73%); COMPANY LOSSES (71%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (70%); MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (65%); AGREEMENTS (64%); BREAST CANCER (61%); CHEMICALS (60%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (60%); CHEMICALS MFG (60%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (92%); AMGEN INC (83%); ABBVIE INC (50%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (92%); AMGN (NASDAQ) (83%); ABBV (PAR) (50%); ABBV (NYSE) (50%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (92%); NAICS541715 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, & LIFE SCIENCES (EXCEPT NANOTECH & BIOTECH) (83%); SIC2836 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS, EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES (83%); SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS (83%)COUNTRY: EUROPE (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (92%); ROMANIA (79%); CROATIA (79%); JAPAN (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); BALTIC STATES (79%); BULGARIA (78%); ESTONIA (58%); LATVIA (58%); EASTERN EUROPE (58%); LITHUANIA (58%)LOAD-DATE: January 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It will invite the players to Korea as well.Kia Motors is improving poor kitchen conditions at elementary schools in low-income regions.For a 'greener' China, Hyundai has planted trees and shrubs in Inner Mongolia since 2008 to prevent desertification.With Korean university students and Chinese volunteer workers, the company finished creating a 50 square-kilometer grassland on the Chakanor salt desert in 2013.It will convert another salt desert into a 40 square-kilometer grassland by 2018.Hyundai Motor Group is promoting its CSR activities in China to its customers, employees, dealers, partners, media and volunteer workers through WeChat.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: AUTOMOBILE MFG (91%); AUTOMAKERS (91%); BUSINESS ETHICS & CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP (91%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); DRIVER EDUCATION (90%); CHILDREN (89%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); SEDANS (78%); MOTOR VEHICLES (78%); WELFARE BENEFITS (76%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (73%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (73%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (70%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (69%); CITIES (64%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (60%); UNITED NATIONS (53%)COMPANY: HYUNDAI MOTOR CO (92%); HYUNDAI MOBIS CO LTD (52%)TICKER: HYUD (LSE) (92%); 005380 (KSE) (92%); 012330 (KSE) (52%)INDUSTRY: NAICS336211 MOTOR VEHICLE BODY MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (92%); SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES & PASSENGER CAR BODIES (92%); SIC3569 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY & EQUIPMENT (92%); SIC3714 MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS & ACCESSORIES (52%)CITY: BEIJING, CHINA (79%); TIANJIN, CHINA (79%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (92%)COUNTRY: CHINA (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 16, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

As president of the academy, I was so proud of the students from different nations who wore gorgeous academic gowns and caps, with big smiles on their faces and certificates of graduation in their hands. During my congratulatory remarks, I asked them to always keep three things in mind wherever they go. I told them, ??First, I want you to build a cultural and literary bridge connecting the world, like the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey. Second, always remember that you are a translator and interpreter between the East and the West, and between Korea and your country. Third, try to become a cultural ambassador of Korea to your nation.??I also told the international students not to forget their professors at the academy even after graduation. I said, ??You could not have had the pleasure and honor of graduating today without the guidance of your professors. In Korea we say, once a teacher, always a teacher. We never refer to our teachers as ??former?? teachers because we believe there is no expiration date for our teachers, mentors and professors. In fact, your teachers are your everlasting milestones and guiding constellations long after graduation.??Finally, I introduced to them the Korean style of friendship that does not care about geographical distance. I told them, ??In English, we say, ??Out of sight, out of mind.?? But Koreans do not seem to abide by the maxim. Once we become friends, our friendship is everlasting, no matter where you are. Actually, Korean folk songs, pop songs and poetry are full of the theme of missing someone who is far away, for example a lover, a friend and a family member.?? I asked the graduating foreign students not to forget their Korean friends as well. I told them, ??I strongly hope that the certificate of graduation will be a constant reminder of your everlasting friendship with Korea, which, I hope, can be your second home and a point of reference to which you return again and again in the future.?? I added, ??Since you can communicate in at least two languages, you have two minds, a dual vision and comparative perspective, which is a blessing. Now you are ready to accomplish what the great American poet Walt Whitman once described as ??a rondure of the world, at last accomplish??d.???? When I had the honor of delivering a speech at the commencement ceremony of the State University of New York at Buffalo a few weeks ago, I urged graduating American students to broaden their horizons so they can hold the world in their arms, embrace ethnic diversity, and accept cultural differences. I said, ??I believe that is the spirit of the humanities, SUNY/Buffalo and the United States!?? I continued, ??I always think of Buffalo, New York as my second hometown because I spent the best years of my life here. Seoul is my primary home to which I constantly return after I travel abroad. But what is a home? A home is a place where you are happy, comfortable, and relaxed. A home is a place where you have family members, relatives and dear friends who care about you. It is a place full of sweet memories of your childhood or adolescence. And it is a place you intensely miss when you are away. If that is the case, then Buffalo is definitely my home.?? Then I urged American students to find their second home elsewhere. ??Even a foreign city or a foreign country can be your second hometown and second homeland.?? Indeed, the new literary movement, Transnationalism, allows loyalty to two countries at the same time these days. I advised graduating American students not to fix their love on one place, but to extend their love to all places, if they want to become a perfect person, a spiritual exile, and a truly global citizen. While addressing the graduating foreign students, I thought about America today that had recently declared, ??America First!?? and ??Make America great again!?? I understand America??s situation fully, and yet I cannot but help noticing there are some contradictions in the two slogans. If you want to be truly great, you are not supposed to say, ??Me first!?? which sounds selfish and childish. To be great is to be generous, diverse and flexible. That is the spirit of America and that is the essence of the American Dream. If America abandons its role of a cross-cultural bridge, interpreter and cultural ambassador, and demanded its allies return the favor monetarily, another country will take its place as the leader of the world. Now I am preaching what I learned from my American professors when America was truly great decades ago. Meanwhile, America seems to be no longer interested in cross-cultural understanding or humanitarian causes. That makes me sad, and yet the original, true American greatness still lives in me as a legacy.

"211","[Park Sang-seek] Rise of racial and ethnic conflicts and world peace",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Park Sang-seek] Rise of racial and ethnic conflicts and world peace   THE KOREA HERALD September 15, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 15, 2017 Friday[Park Sang-seek] Rise of racial and ethnic conflicts and world peace LENGTH: 1082 wordsSamuel Huntington's seminal work 'Clash of Civilizations' has awaked the world leadership to the new threat to world peace in the post-Cold War period. His study concentrated on the clashes between major civilizations. But the real world is suffering from racial, ethnic and religious sectarian conflicts rather than the conflict of civilizations.During the Cold War, political ideology was the main cause of world conflict, although ethnic conflicts in newly independent countries began to surface. Political ideology and religion have similarity in terms of functions: both describe, explain, predict and propagate their views of humanity and the world, but ideology in addition masks and directs. The main goal of political ideology is to gain political power to rule any political entity, whether local units of a state, a state, a region or the world. Religion in the contemporary world is not to rule any political entity but to lead humanity's spiritual world. The only exception is Islam. Forty-five countries of which a majority of the populations are Muslims recognize Islam as the state religion. Among them, 20 countries are Arab and five countries are Asian. In such states Islam performs the same functions as political ideology and consequently becomes a political ideology. The Muslim sectarian conflict between the Sunnis and the Shiites is becoming more and more serious and intensifying the sectarian conflicts within and between Islamic states in the Arab world.The next sources of domestic and international conflicts are racial and ethnic conflicts. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination includes all kinds of discrimination based on race, color, descent and national or ethnic origin in its definition of racial discrimination. In actual reality, ordinary people distinguish people on the base of color and ethnicity. Ethnicity is a concept encompassing descent (actual or imagined), culture (customs) and language. A state can be formed on the basis of one or more races as well as one or more ethnic groups. States which have come into being since WWII are mostly multiethnic states. Race is a scientific term and therefore ordinary people do not distinguish between race and color. According to scientists, the first thing a newborn baby distinguishes is color: If it is white and sees a white-faced person, it smiles. But if it sees a person of a different color, it cries. This means that to ordinary humans skin color is the most important distinguishing factor. In other words, humans classify other humans according to skin color first and classify them as 'usï'or 'themï'(friends or foes). Humans are born racists. A single race can develop different cultures and form different ethnic groups. If people of the same racial and ethnic group form a state, it is called a homogeneous nation-state. Most former Western colonies are multiethnic states although their people belong to the same race. Among the four foundations of the state -- race, ethnicity (culture), religion and political ideology -- political ideology was the strongest tie of the state during the Cold War, and afterwards ethnicity has become the strongest state bond. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, Muslim fundamentalism has become a political ideology and emerged as a strong determinant in the international arena. As Muslim terrorist actions in the West and the ethnic conflicts in the non-West intensify and refugees from the non-West flood into the West, the world is entering into a new age of international relations: the age of racial conflict.There are 57 ongoing armed conflicts in the world. Except for five interstate conflicts, the rest are internal conflicts. The internal conflicts are primordial conflicts (ethnic, religious and sectarian conflicts). Among them, 16 are ethnic and 15 are sectarian conflicts between the Sunnis and the Shiites. The rest are either ideological or political power struggles. It should be noted that regardless of the motives of these conflicts, many of them (13 among them) seek a separate state. Another noticeable fact is that most of these conflicts take place in developing countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It is not surprising because most countries in these regions are newly independent and their territorial boundaries are based on the colonial boundaries that their respective colonial powers created, disregarding the ethnic and religious boundaries of their colonial units.These two main causes of conflicts are spreading to the Western world at a rapid pace. The acceleration of globalization expedites this process. Liberal internationalists have been overjoyed over this rapid progress of globalization. But they have overlooked the destructive impact of globalization. Globalization has accelerated the gap between the rich and the poor between and within all states mainly because the capitalist economy and free trade have accelerated the income gap between and within states, while all kinds of electronic mass media have exposed this wealth gap to the poor peoples in the poor nations to this wealth gap and prompted them to migrate to rich Western nations. As primordial conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East aggravate, their victims desperately flee to their colonial mastersï'homelands and seek asylum. But these refugees and their former masters belong to different races and ethnic and religious groups. Under the circumstances, the conflict between white Westerners and refugees of color becomes inevitable. To make matters worse, the white natives in the West fear Muslim extremists among the refugees and immigrants. Poor whites are more antagonistic toward Muslim immigrants or refugees mainly because they are less liberal and more chauvinistic than more educated and wealthier whites. Now and hereafter the whole world will suffer from racism and extremist religious movements. Both non-white and white-dominant countries are responsible for world peace. The former should make all-out efforts to overcome primordial conflicts within their states, while the latter should deal with the refugee and immigration issues jointly and in close cooperation with the former and international organizations.By Park Sang-seekPark Sang-seek is a former rector at the Graduate Institute of Peace Studies at Kyung Hee University and the author of 'Globalized Korea and Localized Globe.ï'-- Ed.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: RELIGION (96%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (92%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (91%); ETHNICITY (90%); RACE & ETHNICITY (90%); COLD WAR (90%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (89%); ETHNIC GROUPS (89%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (89%); DISCRIMINATION (89%); POLITICS (76%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); WORLD WAR II (72%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (60%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (50%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: September 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"212","'Anna Karenina' in toe shoes -",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"November","'Anna Karenina' in toe shoes -  Korea Times November 2, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesNovember 2, 2017 Thursday'Anna Karenina' in toe shoes -LENGTH: 1038 wordsA pas de deux between Anna and Vronsky from the Spuck version of ballet ""Anna Karenina"" / Courtesy of Korean National BalletBallet version of legendary novel showcased as part of PyeongChang Olympics' culture campaign By Yun Suh-youngExactly 100 days before the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics start on Feb. 9, the Korean National Ballet staged 'Anna Karenina' in Seoul at the Seoul Arts Center's opera theater. The ballet was performed as part of the Cultural Olympiad Guide, a culture campaign that takes place before and during the Olympics, from Nov. 1 to 5. It will also be performed during the Olympics from Feb. 10 to 11 at the Olympic Art Center in Gangneung, Gangwon Province.Having been chosen as the piece for the Olympics, the production offers cheaper tickets (sponsored by the government) whose highest price is marked at 50,000 won, making it more affordable than the usual price for ballets.'Anna Karenina,' written by Leo Tolstoy, is a tragic story of married aristocrat Anna Karenina who falls in love with the affluent Count Vronsky in 19th century Russia, which leads to her consequential demise. Anna throws herself into illicit love, abandoning her marriage, her child and her stable life, despite the pressures and social stigmas of the times. Being ostracized by the social circles she is part of, and later abandoned by her newfound love Vronsky, Anna struggles emotionally and takes her own life.A pas de deux between Anna and Vronsky in ""Anna Karenina"" / Courtesy of Korean National BalletKang Sue-jin, artistic director of Korean National Ballet, said the piece was selected for the Olympics because 'Anna Karenina' is internationally well-known. 'The piece will allow people to enjoy different genres of music and different styles of ballet,' she said.The chosen 'Anna Karenina' is a version by choreographer Christian Spuck, artistic director of Ballet Zurich in Switzerland. Ballet Zurich premiered it on Oct. 12, 2014, and it was received with positive reviews for its choreography, stage art and costumes.When asked what attracted him to 'Anna Karenina,' Spuck said he was drawn to the character Anna who plunged herself into a dangerous romance, kicking away a stable marriage. It took him almost two years preparing this production, mulling over which parts of the massive classical masterpiece to extract scenes from.He focused on the drama of the ballet, emphasizing acting over dancing for this particular piece, bringing out emotions instead of aesthetics. He focused on the love triangle between Anna, Vronsky and Karenin, Anna's husband, while trying to bring out the social environment and atmosphere of 19th century Russia through the corps de ballet.Spuck chose music by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff and Polish composer Witold Lutoslawski to balance each other out. While Rachmaninoff is represented by serious and mellow tunes, Lutoslawski was added for strength to maximize emotion.Anna and Karenin with the corps de ballet in ""Anna Karenina"" / Courtesy of Korean National BalletFeast for the eyesThe first impression after watching this ballet version of 'Anna Karenina,' in one word, was 'beautiful.' The costumes, designed by London-based set and costume designer Emma Ryott, were breathtaking. The weight of the masterpiece was felt through the costumes, as if they brought the atmosphere of the period alive. It is said the production spent a large part of its 2 billion won budget on the costumes, and surely they played their part.Choreography and acting were dramatic as intended, while live music playing in the background ? by both a pianist and an orchestra (Korean Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paul Connelly) ? enlivened the intensity. For the rehearsal, pianist Cho Jae-hyuck played both on and below the stage in the orchestra pit. Cho and pianist Kim Go-eun are performing interchangeably for the five-day run.The stage was designed with minimalism, in contrast to the flamboyance of the costumes. Other than wooden bench props and tree trunks, the only other visual aid was a moveable curtain screen on which they projected videos of a train approaching the station, a racetrack on which Vronsky rides a horse, and the railway where Anna takes her life.The overall tone of the stage and performance were dark and heavy, reflecting the weight of the original plot. This is a performance more suited for adults than teenagers, and to those who have endured the pain of reading through the 900-page novel. Understanding the storyline will double the entertainment, as it will be difficult for non-readers and non-ballet enthusiasts to follow the story through the three-hour performance.However, as much as the performance was a feast for the eyes, there was room for spicing up in other areas.In between the music and choreography there were, at times, awkward pauses in which the dancers performed in (what seemed like) uncomfortable silence to the audience. Some repetitive sequences also could have been halved to keep the audience from drifting away.And most importantly ? understandably being limited in the genre ? the performance couldn't fully bring to life the intensity and depth of the novel, in which Tolstoy manifests his philosophy on life, love and spirituality.The intensity of the emotions felt by the characters in the novel didn't really seep through in the ballet. The contemplation of the characters, questioning the reason for and the significance of their existence, questioning how humanity's purpose of life aligns with piecemeal and fragmentary daily lives of humans ? a mental quest ventured in the novel ? were hardly felt.One suggestion would be to emphasize the two stories that run parallel to each other in the novel ? one of Levin, a character in which Tolstoy reflects his philosophy and spirituality on, and of Anna, through which Tolstoy explores human nature in the physical realm, of personal fulfillment. The emotions and struggles of both Anna and Levin, which is in contrast ? physical versus spiritual satisfaction ? could have been expressed through their simultaneous solo performances on stage.However, for the courage of turning this massive classical masterpiece into a ballet, the production surely deserves applause.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: BALLET (92%); DANCE COMPANIES (90%); 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS (90%); OLYMPICS (90%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (90%); MUSIC (89%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (89%); CHOREOGRAPHY (89%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (89%); DANCE (89%); DANCERS (78%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (78%); MUSIC GENRES (76%); THEATER (76%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (74%); MARRIAGE (72%); SUICIDE (67%)CITY: ZURICH (90%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); SWITZERLAND (90%); CENTRAL EUROPE (52%)LOAD-DATE: November 2, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

But what I said was a principle and for this to take effect in reality, we need more detailed standards,?? Moon said.??Had there been a transition committee, we would have drawn detailed rules on personnel appointment in advance (before inauguration) but due to the lack of time and the consequently pressing schedule, the appointments came to face disputes.??President Moon took office on May 10, without a transition period right after the May 9 election, to fill in state leadership that had remained vacant since former President Park Geun-hye??s ouster by impeachment on March 10.Earlier in the morning, two presidential aides made their way to the National Assembly, seeking to pacify the opposition, which since last week had been demanding for the president??s direct apology over what they saw as faulty choices. In a multilateral meeting with Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and floor leaders of four parties, Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Jun Byung-hun explained the presidential office would reinforce the nominee verification process. ??It is true that the prime minister appointment was made in a hurry as we were trying to minimize the vacuum (in state affairs),?? Jun said in the meeting, offering an apology to the participants.This was the second apologetic gesture from Cheong Wa Dae, following that by presidential chief of staff Im Jong-seok on Friday.Pressure has been mounting for a new prime minister to succeed Hwang Kyo-ahn. But with Lee??s nomination up in the air, the role is currently being filled by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoo Il-ho, who is also set to step down. Jun also underlined that the president would not nominate anyone with a false address registration record after July 2005, when the confirmation hearing system was first introduced.When it comes to breaches before July 2005, the presidential office will only rule out those who had intentions of real estate speculation, he added.The Residence Registration Act states that one may be sentenced to a maximum term of three years or a fine of 10 million won ($8,921) for falsely reporting one??s address. The key purpose of the regulation was to deter excessive real estate speculation, a defect often found in high-profile public servant nominees in the past.While the main conservative opposition Liberty Korea Party continued to oppose the nomination, the other two parties -- the People??s Party and the Bareun Party -- backed down and said they would review Cheong Wa Dae??s renewed personnel standards.Despite the brawl over the president??s personnel decisions, public sentiment remained largely in support of the new state leader over the weekend.According to a survey released by pollster Realmeter on Monday, those in favor of President Moon??s state administration stood at 84.1 percent, up 2.5 percentage points from the previous week.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com) and Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (79%); TALKS & MEETINGS (79%); POLITICS (79%); PERSONNEL CHANGES (79%); APPOINTMENTS (79%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (77%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (71%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (71%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (70%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (65%); CORRUPTION (65%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (94%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 29, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

'We agreed to resolve North Korean nuclear issue peacefully, and to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula,' Moon said at a joint press conference at Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office. Saying that he and Trump renewed the resolve to work together on the issue, Moon said that the two countries agreed to strengthen the allied defense posture. Moon said that the two countries will 'cooperate on an unprecedented level' in boosting South Korea's defense capabilities, and to immediately begin talks regarding acquisition and development of new military equipment by South Korea. Moon also revealed that the agreement to lift restrictions on South Korea's ballistic missile payload was finalized. According to Cheong Wa Dae, the two sides adopted new missile guidelines that impose no limits on Korea's missiles during the day's summit talks. A high-level Korean official later revealed that the weapons acquisition and development talks concern nuclear-powered submarines and surveillance assets. 'Nuclear-powered submarines and cutting-edge surveillance assets are included (in the talks). An agreement was reached in principle, but there are many elements that must be reviewed and discussed,ï'the official said on condition of anonymity. Overall, Trump's remarks concerning North Korea echoed those of Moon, and he urged the international community to work together in pressuring the regime. 'North Korea's sixth test of a nuclear device and its missile launches are a threat not only to the people of South Korea but to the people all across our globe,ï'Trump said. 'North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation, including China and Russia, to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs, and live in peace.'Trump, however, warned that the US would bring its military into the equation if necessary. 'As we work together to resolve this problem using all of available tools short of military action, the US stands to prepare to defend itself and allies using full range of unmatched military capabilities if need be,ï'Trump said.In response to a question on whether he viewed the situation to be progressing, Trump said that 'it makes senseï'for North Korea to denuclearize and that such a decision would be 'for humanity all over the world.'He said there is 'certain movement,ï'but declined to elaborate on the possibility of engaging North Korea directly. On the issue of bilateral trade, Trump reiterated his assessment of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, saying the two sides are looking to improve economic relations. 'I would like to thank President Moon for instructing his trade negotiators to work closely with us to quickly pursue a much better deal -- a deal that, frankly, has been quite unsuccessful and not very good for the United States,ï'Trump said. Although Seoul had maintained that the trade pact was reciprocal in nature, the two sides are now working on modifying the deal. Against much speculation from local pundits, the issue of South Korea's share of US military costs incurred here was not given significant mention. Ahead of Trump's visit, local media and experts had raised the possibility that Trump could use his state visit to raise the concern. Korea's presidential office also appeared wary of the possibility, with officials highlighting the significance of Camp Humphreys, the first stop on Trump's South Korean itinerary, on a number of occasions. Located in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, the installation is the largest overseas base operated by the US. Building the base has incurred costs of about $10 billion, over 90 percent of which has been shouldered by Seoul.

"215","Hunger bonds",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"May","Hunger bonds  Korea Times May 29, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesMay 29, 2017 MondayHunger bondsBYLINE: By Ricardo HausmannLENGTH: 964 wordsCAMBRIDGE - Investing often creates moral dilemmas over goals: Should we aim to do well or to do good? Is it appropriate to invest in tobacco companies? Or in companies that sell guns to drug gangs?The recent popularity of so-called impact investment funds, which promise to deliver decent returns while advancing social or environmental goals, is based on this unease. Foundations often find that these investment vehicles help them to do good both with the money that they spend on philanthropy and with the endowment assets that yield the returns on which their philanthropy depends.Nowadays, it is emerging markets as an asset class that should make people morally queasy. Should decent people put their money in emerging-market bond funds?The returns of the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI+) are heavily influenced by what happens in Venezuela. The reason is simple: while Venezuela represents only about 5% of the index, it accounts for about 20% of its yield, because the yield on Venezuelan debt is about five times larger than that of other countries in the index, a reflection of the huge risk premium that Venezuela faces. Moreover, the price volatility of Venezuelan debt ¡© the highest in the EMBI+ ¡© accounts for a disproportionate share of the index's daily price movements.You might invest in the EMBI+ because it promises higher returns, or because you want to make your savings available to a larger segment of humanity. But if you do, you will root for Venezuelan debt, which means wishing for really bad things to happen to Venezuela's people.As has been widely reported in the media, Venezuela is experiencing one of the most calamitous economic collapses ever, accompanied by massive doses of political repression and human-rights violations. So investing in the EMBI+ means that you rejoice when Wall Street analysts inform you that the country is literally starving its people in order to avoid restructuring your bonds.Your happiness is easily explained: Venezuelan imports, after having collapsed by 75% from 2012 to 2016, are down more than 20% in the first quarter of 2017. That's good news for you as an EMBI+ investor, because it means that more money is left to service your bonds. Meanwhile, Venezuelans are involuntarily losing weight and searching for food in garbage piles. Sure, it's a humanitarian catastrophe. But, to you, it's a fabulous investment opportunity.Now assume that you want to hold Venezuelan debt because you are hoping that President Nicolás Maduro will lose power and that a more sensible, democratically minded government, more in line with your moral compass, will emerge. Even in that case, you will still want the gains from Venezuela's future recovery to be used preferentially to service the old debt issued to finance the corruption and national destruction brought about by Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. You will not be rooting for the recovery of livelihoods that Venezuelans deserve after having lived through this nightmare.You will also be rooting for US judges to seize assets and impound money to pay you. In fact, analysts who are bullish on Venezuelan debt have been lobbying the government and opposition leaders with an implied threat: even considering a restructuring of your bonds, they point out, will allow those managing your assets to cause havoc in Venezuela.If you are a decent human being, investing in Venezuelan bonds should make you feel 'mildly nauseous,' to borrow a phrase recently used by former FBI Director James Comey while testifying to the US Congress. Emerging-market fund managers feel a similar discomfort. They currently spend a disproportionate share of their time 'getting the Venezuelan call right,' because their bonuses are based on their over-performance relative to the index ¡© of which Venezuela is the main driver.The less morally burdened among them bask in the recognition they receive for having been right to predict that Maduro's government would decide to starve its people rather than restructure the bonds you hold. Analysts and bondholders have also lobbied the government and the opposition not to seek financial support from the International Monetary Fund, for fear that the international community will demand that you accept a significant 'haircut' on your investment, as has been required of Greece's creditors.That would probably not be 'good for the credit.' Analysts and bondholders have also lobbied the opposition-controlled National Assembly to recognize Venezuela's external debt in exchange for the freedom of political prisoners, implying that the payment of your bonds can be secured through ransom.So, should you stop investing in emerging-market funds just because 5% of your savings would go toward financing Venezuela? Clearly, this would punish other countries that are innocent bystanders in the Venezuelan mess. There must be a better way.There is. The solution is to demand that JPMorgan immediately exclude Venezuela from the emerging market bond indexes it calculates, thereby freeing fund managers from the need to compare their performance with hunger bonds. Over time, JPMorgan should introduce a Decent Emerging Markets index, which would save you from moral anguish by ensuring that only countries adhering to minimal standards of respect for their citizens are included. The DEM would allow you to root for higher returns on your savings without wishing for human misery. You could do well, without feeling bad.Ricardo Hausmann, a former minister of planning of Venezuela and former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank, is director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University and a professor of economics at the Harvard Kennedy School.

The 151-year-old publisher Henry Holt has never had as great a success as with this book. Trump denied that any interviews or access to the White House staff were granted, but all 200 interviews, including with Trump, have been quoted in the audio book just released.The key interviewee Steve Bannon has stepped down from Breitbart News Network. A key architect of the Trump victory in the 2016 presidential election, he was appointed as the chief strategist in the Trump White House, and then fired. He designed Trump's first 100 days as president. Wolff was lucky to have Bannon's rise and fall for this book. Without Bannon's accounts of Trump and his children and his close associates, this could not have reached its status as the fastest-selling book in the publisher's history.Almost everything written in the book is already known to the public, but it confirms all the rumors as true, even though some critics say this book is a sensational half-backed truth written in tabloid style. Of course, the words uttered and written in the book are interpreted by the author. This kind of book cannot be scientific. Each sentence does not need to be proven and verified by the interviewees.Trump people in the White House do not read a memo of more than one page. They just read Trump's tweets. Bannon was the only one who read memos longer than one page. This may be exaggerated, but Trump does not read. He only listens and watches Fox and Friends and tweets in response to Fox and Friends. What do you expect from the Trump White House?Wolff claims that '100 percent of people around the president question his intelligence and fitness for office.' That may be exaggerated. However, everyone surrounding Trump may know in their hearts that Trump is not intelligent and is not fit for office.Most probably, Trump himself knows it. He knew that he was an unelectable president during the campaign period and an un-presidential president after the inauguration, accidentally elected by an antiquated electoral system. He himself was once critical of that system.One chapter is devoted to the Election Day; the scene and mood of the Trump people. Wolff sketched all their pursuits after the Election Day, not in the White House. Trump and his campaign staff tried to take advantage of finding other jobs using their campaign experience. Two campaign managers and key staff members were kicked out during the campaign period. Trump believed that the campaign managers were not competent enough to lead the campaign, and never believed his own weaknesses and faults.The final campaign team lost hope when Billy Bush revealed Trump's words about his relationships with women, that all women liked to be touched and groped by him, such a famous and rich man. This statement was very convincingly fatal to their campaign. On the last day, FBI director James Comey rescued him when he opened Hillary Clinton's email server. Anyway, many competent men and women did not join the campaign due to Trump's supposedly unelectable character.Bannon said a meeting of Trump's children and campaign manager Paul Manafort with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in New York after the election victory was 'treasonous and unpatriotic' for basically money-laundering. Bannon's words will be very critical information to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation team.Trump immediately attacked Wolff's book as fake. He does not remember his meeting with Wolff during his presidential campaign and Wolff's article, 'Donald Trump Conversation: Politics Dark Heart is Having the Best Time Anyone's Ever Had,' in the Hollywood Reporter in June 2016.This article was Wolff's stepping stone to the White House after the Trump inauguration. Trump's shouting is not a surprise at all to me and many people. But I question his mental fitness. He may not remember things that have happened not long ago. His mental fitness was first brought up by a Yale psychiatrist. Ronald Reagan was much older than Trump. Reagan's mental illness was revealed much later after he retired from the White House. Trump is just entering his second year in the White House.Since the Trump inauguration, the stock market has been booming with record-breaking highs and the war with ISIS has been subdued. That must be credited to him. However, his character and mental fitness to run the United States of America are serious matters in predicting his future in the White House. Reckless deregulation and massive military intervention in the Middle East may herald a rising stock market and subduing the war. However, the soundness of all presidential policymaking is to be seen.Wolff made it clear that he 'inserted his moral right' into the book. His moral right as a writer is his fair interpretation of 200 interviews conducted for the book. That insertion is desirable and justice-as-fairness. He also made it clear that 'Fire and Fury,' the title of the book, came from Trump's response to North Korean nuclear and missile programs. I recommend this book to all those who are interested in American politics.Choi Yearn-hong is a political scientist who retired after a long teaching career in the U.S. and Korea.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); POLITICS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); ELECTIONS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (89%); BOOK REVIEWS (78%); TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS (78%); LITERARY CRITICISM (78%); WRITERS (78%); RESIGNATIONS (78%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); BESTSELLERS (73%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (92%); STEVE BANNON (79%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (95%)LOAD-DATE: January 12, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

If the flow of oil slows or stops, the pipeline becomes blocked, which in turn is expensive to repair. The pipeline can even be damaged beyond repair in extreme cases,' Liu said.The pipeline's crude supplies are from the Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang province and are typicallylow in sulphur and high in wax. The mix solidifies easily in cold weather or when the flow slows to a certain point, according to a PetroChina Pipeline Research and Development Centre report.China would have to go to great expense to clear any solid wax inside the pipeline, and the infrastructure could be irreparably damaged if the wax content exceeded a threshold, the report said.The pipeline, also called the Friendship Oil Pipeline, runs for more than 30km from storage facilities in the Chinese border city of Dandong to an oil depot in Sinuiju in North Korea.It was completed in December 1975, and supplies 520,000 tonnes (3.64 million barrels) of heavy crude oil each year, according to its operator, China National Petroleum Corporation.Chinese customs authorities have not publicly reported the total volume of crude exports to North Korea since January 2014, but in 2013, 590,000 tonnes went from China to its neighbour.Once across the border, the crude is processed at North Korea's sole working refinery, the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, a facility built with Chinese support in the 1970s.The refinery turns the oil into refined products for North Korea's government, military, transport, agricultural and fishing sectors, according to 38 North, a website run by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Reports leading up to Monday's UN Security Council vote said the United States was pressing for a total oil embargo against North Korea, but China and Russia resisted the blanket ban and a 'watered down' resolution was adopted instead.Justin Hastings, an international relations specialist in Sino-North Korean trade at the University of Sydney, said Beijing did not want to generate more ill will from Pyongyang by cutting its lifeline, given that China's endorsement of previous UN sanctions had already triggered resentment from North Korea.'China's policy is to force North Korea to the negotiating table, not to its knees, so it builds in exemptions like this to give it the ability to keep the regime alive,' Hastings said.'Perhaps more importantly, banning all crude oil imports except what China provides through one pipeline gives China a lot of leverage over North Korea, assuming other countries adhere to the ban. This may be just as important as the ban itself.'David von Hippel, from the California-based Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability, said Beijing did not want to see a humanitarian crisis in the hermit state.'China probably excluded this pipeline for the same reason that it has insisted on humanitarian or normal economic trade clauses in previous resolutions ? both to protect Chinese business interests and to keep the North Korea oil supplies at levels sufficient to ensure that [North Korea's] society will not break down,' von Hippel said. 'The Chinese fear [this] will result in a flood of refugees coming across its border, as well as ... geopolitical chaos.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CRUDE OIL PIPELINES (91%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (91%); OIL & GAS FACILITIES (90%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (89%); IMPORT TRADE (78%); PETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTS (78%); OIL & GAS STORAGE FACILITIES (78%); OIL & GAS EXPORTS & IMPORTS (78%); EXPORT TRADE (77%); TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE (75%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (74%); NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS (73%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (68%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (65%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (65%)COMPANY: CHINA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORP (83%); PETROCHINA CO LTD (53%)TICKER: PTR (NYSE) (53%); K3OD (SGX) (53%); 0857 (HKSE) (53%)INDUSTRY: NAICS213112 SUPPORT ACTIVITIES FOR OIL & GAS OPERATIONS (83%); SIC1389 OIL & GAS FIELD SERVICES, NEC (83%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES (53%); NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (53%); NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (53%); NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION (53%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (91%); SHANGHAI, CHINA (79%); BEIJING, CHINA (73%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (79%); EAST CHINA (79%); NORTHEAST CHINA (79%); HEILONGJIANG, CHINA (78%)COUNTRY: CHINA (98%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: September 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

I sketched using my imagination and also took inspirations from old photos.??Im was one of 30 artists from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose 60 artworks are on display at an exhibition in Seoul. Organized by the ASEAN-Korea Center in Seoul in conjunction with the 2017 Asian Students and Young Artists Art Festival, the event runs through Aug. 20 featuring everything from oil paintings to installation pieces. Ten artists from ASEAN were invited to showcase their works, network and discuss their vocational issues with their Korean counterparts and art directors. The years under the Khmer Rouge from 1968 to 1994 have remained ??a very sad story?? of his homeland, said Im. The communist armed guerilla group led by politician and revolutionary Pol Pot and others carried out numerous genocides of Cambodian minorities, killing an estimated 1.5 to 3 million people in the late 1970s. ??Everything was destroyed and Cambodians had nothing to live off,?? he said, adding several members of his own family and relatives died or became casualties. ??Although I was not born at that time, I heard about the appalling tales from my family, relatives and teachers. The young Cambodians have been taught to study the history so that the ghosts of our dark past will never haunt us again.??Young Cambodians today understand that peace is priceless and nonnegotiable, both within their national borders as well as across borders, he added.Im, who also teaches at private Japanese institution Yamada School of Art in Phnom Penn, said the new voices of Cambodia desire fervently to be ??part of the new story?? of nation-building unfolding in the country. ??We need to build our economy, society, education and culture, and art is very important in this respect,?? he said. Im stressed that artists have a duty to regain the glory of ancient Cambodian art that created the likes of the 12th-century Hindu-Buddhist temple-complex of Angkor Wat. The art of the Khmer Empire (802-1431), centered on its capital Angkor, created magnificent edifices and stone carvings that survive to this day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile weaving, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals and kite-making, largely produced for practical use or royal functions.Following decades of artistic decline in the late 20th century under the Khmer Rouge, art has experienced a revival on the back of increased support from the government, nongovernmental organizations and foreign tourists.The average Cambodian does not know much about art, and does not have much money to spend on it, Im said, but the growing number of foreign tourists and businesspeople have become Cambodian artists?? main patrons. ??Still, artists have to work hard to promote their works, advertising online and social media and building connections,?? according to Im. ??It requires a strong conviction to be an artist.?? Im said he likes to draw humble, rustic lives of people and unsullied landscapes in the impressionistic style. He argued that art is a crucial tool for promoting Cambodian culture and society, as the country remains culturally obscure on the world stage. ??Artists have the power to bridge Cambodia with other countries around the world,?? he said. ??I want my paintings to give joy and merriment to people otherwise feeling melancholic and stressed from their lives. I want to illuminate our beautiful people and nature.??Oni Jamsari, a Malaysian artist from Kuala Lumpur, featured two artworks outlining women??s silhouettes at the event. A native of the industrious Malaysian capital, Jamsari said she longed for the years when Kuala Lumpur was still relatively undeveloped and blessed with natural rivers, woods and farmland. One of her works mimics the city??s unadulterated landscape with verdant greens and shadows, harking back to an age without electricity. She also used the same nails worked with by her father in building their home.Describing Malaysia as a vibrant multicultural nation, Jamsari said artists of various ethnicities, including Malay, Chinese, Indian, indigenous peoples and others, bounce ideas off each other for inspiration and collaborate without prejudice. ??Ethnic Chinese artists draw traditional Malay clothing or use it as a material, while Muslim artists decorate their works of art with Chinese and Indian symbols,?? she explained. ??Because we grew up together, it??s very easy and natural to identify ourselves with different national designs.??Jamsari conceded that it was not easy to earn money as an artist in Malaysia, but ??there are still ways to be commercially viable?? by harnessing connections and promoting their talents on traditional and social media.??Artists need to push themselves to be smart and stay in touch with potential buyers and dealers,?? she said. ??You need to continue to expose yourself through exhibitions, media interviews, etc., but don??t push too much. Just do it smoothly. It??s like any other job.??Noting that Korean movies, television dramas and K-pop music are popular in Malaysia, Jamsari acknowledged that Korean art was not well-known. She encouraged Korean artists to raise their profiles through exhibitions and university residency programs, or to look for teaching opportunities in Malaysia.??Different from older generations, young Malaysians are really globally minded and thirsty for interaction with outsiders,?? she highlighted. Umi Zaty Bazillah Zakaria of Brunei displayed paintings inspired by the country??s official identity: the Malay Islamic monarchy. Her paintings, separated into three canvases, portray the landmark Water Village in capital Bandar Seri Begawan, a key tourist spot there. As Brunei is a Muslim society, artists mostly draw things related to Islam in their paintings and calligraphy, she said, adding they also experiment with trendy techniques and digital technologies. Islam-oriented works, calligraphies and portraits, among other things, ??are what people buy,?? she said, noting Bruneians purchase objects of art ??for a specific purpose.?? Works of nudity or politically charged messages are not impermissible, but are veiled from the public eye, according to Zakaria. ??You can draw those sexually or politically provocative things, but can??t really show them in public,?? she said. ??You need to set your own limit as an artist. Keep those things to yourself.??By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (92%); ASEAN COUNTRIES (91%); EXHIBITIONS (90%); PAINTING (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (77%); HISTORY (76%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (76%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%); FESTIVALS (68%); BUDDHISTS & BUDDHISM (66%); RELIGION (63%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (63%); TEXTILES (60%); SILVERWARE & HOLLOWARE MFG (60%)ORGANIZATION: ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS (94%)CITY: PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA (94%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: CAMBODIA (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA (79%); ASIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: July 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Ju won a gold medal in the 2016 International Mathematical Olympiad, ranking first among 602 participants of 109 countries.'One should expose oneself to a diverse range of activities, while thinking of their meaning,' Ju said.'These experiences may serve as a time of rest, or as a detonator of growth, or as an aid in conducting research in one's field of choice in the future.'Ko said 'I took my time studying math and I think it's fine to take things slow.

We must peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue no matter how many ups and downs there are,"" Moon said in a ceremony marking the 72nd anniversary of the country's liberation from the 1910-1945 Japanese colonial rule.""The government will further step up its diplomatic efforts to make sure the international community's principle of peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue will not waiver,"" he added.Moon's remarks come amid escalating tension between the United States and the North that many here believe may lead to the outbreak of armed conflict if not an all-out war.Pyongyang says it is considering staging a missile exercise around the U.S.-controlled island of Guam that is viewed as a clear and direct threat to the United States.Washington has warned that it can move to counter Pyongyang's threats militarily, with U.S. President Donald Trump going a step further saying the option to use force is ""locked and loaded"" and ready for implementation.Moon apparently sought to calm both sides, saying no military action should take place without Seoul's consent.""Military action on the Korean Peninsula can only be decided by the Republic of Korea and no one may decide to take military action without the consent of the Republic of Korea,"" Moon said, referring to his country by its official name.Still, the South Korean leader said his country will also enhance its own defense capabilities to ensure peace.""At the same time, we will keep our doors open for military dialogue to make sure the military tension between the South and the North will not worsen,"" the president said.He repeated his call on the communist North to halt its provocations and return to the dialogue table.""North Korea must remember that when it suspended its missile tests or declared a suspension to nuclear tests was when the North-South Korean relations were at their best. That was when North Korea-U.S., North Korea-Japan talks were promoted and multilateral diplomacy in the Northeast Asian region flourished,"" Moon said.""The resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue must start from a nuclear freeze. North Korea must at least halt its nuclear and missile provocations before conditions for dialogue can be created,"" he added.He said his country will help ensure the economic development of the North, as well as the safety of its communist regime, should the impoverished nation choose the right path.""I once again clarify. We do not want North Korea's collapse. We will not pursue reunification by absorption nor seek any type of artificial unification.""""Should North Korea continue down this path, there will only be isolation and a dark future for the North. We, too, cannot but increase our sanctions and pressure against the North even if we do not wish to,"" he said.The South Korean president again extended his invitation for the North to take part in the upcoming Winter Olympic Games to be held in South Korea's PyeongChang, calling it a ""great chance for the South and the North to take a step toward peace.""He also urged other countries in Northeast Asia, including Japan, to join efforts in institutionalizing regional security and economic cooperation.But to this end, the South Korean leader said Japan must first look squarely at the countries' shared past and admit its past wrongdoing.""The government will expand various exchanges, including shuttle diplomacy, for the development of Korea-Japan relations. But we cannot overlook historical issues just because the future of Korea and Japan is important. Rather, the mutual trust of the two countries will only deepen when they squarely address history-related issues,"" the chief executive said.Moon earlier hinted at scrapping the 2015 agreement between Seoul and Tokyo over Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.The deal, signed by Seoul's former conservative administration, sought to forgive Japan for its war atrocities once and for all in exchange for a mere 10 billion yen ($9.1 million).""In dealing with history issues between South Korea and Japan, such as Japan's sexual slavery and forced labor of Korean people, there exists an international standard of restoring one's honor, compensation, fact-finding and a promise to prevent a recurrence of such events based on universal values of humanity and national consensus,"" the South Korean leader said.""Our government will stand by these principles,"" he added.

"222","Best Korean movies of 2017",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","Best Korean movies of 2017   THE KOREA HERALD December 26, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 26, 2017 TuesdayBest Korean movies of 2017 LENGTH: 1356 wordsAnother year has come to a wrap up the Korean film industry. Genres continue to be limited to political thrillers and crime flicks, and the lack of female roles persists. Despite the lack of diversity, however, 2017 turned out to be a year that offered several pleasant, unexpected surprises for moviegoers. Quieter, more pensive films excelled this year, offering insight into humanity and the everyday. OkjaAdventure, fantasy Directed by Bong Joon-ho Distributed by Netflix, Next Entertainment World'Okja' is a film full of heart, an optimistic story that also peers into some of the most twisted aspects of a social order mankind has created for themselves. ã€€Vegetarians and environmentalists hailed the film as an effective campaign tool against the mass-production of meat, and though it makes an excellent case, the film is much more than an advocate for green eating. It speaks of universal issues such as the need for empathy, the inevitable pang of growing up and facing a vicious world, the inhumane order of capitalism and the terrible consequences that one person's envy can cause. ã€€At once a coming-of-age tale, satire and good old-fashioned adventure ride, led by the indefatigable young heroine Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun), 'Okjaï'once again proves director Bong's unique sensitivity and intellect. It includes picturesque Korean landscapes, large-scale yet detailed chase scenes, a richly layered story and an equally diverse cast. The FortressHistorical dramaDirected by Hwang Dong-hyuk Distributed by CJ Entertainment In Korea, dozens of period pieces are made every year for both film and television, but 'The Fortressï'is that rare example of a historical drama that appreciates history in all its complexity. ã€€It also invites viewers to ponder philosophical issues through characters who seem to adhere to a higher moral standard than the modern bureaucrat. The year is 1636. The location, Namhansanseong, a mountain fortress southeast of Seoul. Joseon's King Injo (Park Hae-il), his advisers and people are trapped within its walls in the freezing winter, unable to escape from or fight against a Chinese invasion. ã€€At the center of the film lies the ideological struggle that ensues as the king's two highest advisors -- Choi Myung-gil (Lee Byung-hun) and Kim Sang-hun (Kim Yoon-seok) -- fiercely debate on the course of action to take. Choi opts to surrender, arguing that life and survival precede lofty ideals, while Kim, staunchly believing that the only meaningful life is one with honor and dignity, argues Joseon should fight even if it means death. ã€€The film's debate mirrors the philosophical tension that was pervasive throughout the Joseon era; some scholars today argue that it was Joseon's excessive emphasis on form and formality that led to its demise. In the film, both arguments, meanwhile, pale when compared to the brutal reality of people dying from frostbite and starvation. The Running ActressDrama, comedyDirected by Moon So-ri Distributed by MetaplayHumorous, intelligent and reflective, this is a gem of a film and the directorial feature debut of acclaimed actress Moon So-ri, known for films such as 'Oasis.ï'Moon, who penned, directed and starred in the film, tells a semi-autobiographical three-part story about the daily life of an actress, which usually begins and ends in a breakdown in her van. ã€€Moon struggles with the gap between the cachet people place on actresses -- 'You must not eat (cheap) food like this!ï'-- and the painfully menial, often demeaning, details of her actual daily routine. With a livelihood that relies so heavily on 'personal charmï'and 'beauty,ï'the actress perennially wavers between confidence in her skills, the courage to ask for better roles and intense insecurity. The film ends with a stirring contemplation on art and life. The First LapDramaDirected by Kim Dae-hwan Distributed by Indieplug With his sophomore feature, Kim Dae-hwan proves once again that he has a keen eye for capturing the real Korean family. His debut work 'End of Winterï'observed how deep-seated resentments begin manifesting themselves after a family is snowed in in their hometown. ã€€'The First Lapï'focuses on a young couple as they attempt to navigate adult life, meet each other's families and evade, for as long as possible, that daunting institution of marriage for fear of turning out like their respective parents. In two achingly naturalistic performances that were in large part adlibbed, according to director Kim, Jo Hyun-chul and Kim Sae-byuk bring to life a thoroughly average millennial Korean couple and all their blunders. The MercilessCrime, actionDirected by Byun Sung-hyunDistributed by CJ Entertainment Director Byun made an explosive debut with the stylish noir 'The Merciless,ï'which was invited to Cannes Film Festival's midnight screenings in May. ã€€The value of this film lies in its style -- its bold, vintage colors, the meticulous arrangement of the buildings and people -- and how it follows the emotions of its two lead characters, the seemingly hardened gangster Han Jae-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) and reckless young delinquent Jo Hyun-soo (Im Si-wan). Their relationship evolves to become deeper than a bromance and more calculated than a romance. The film's box office numbers, meanwhile, received a blow due to public outrage at director Byun's sexual tweets about his actors, for which the director subsequently apologized. Distinctly 'Koreanï'films that soothed the souls of Koreans'A Taxi Driver,ï'directed by Jang Hoon, became the 11th most-viewed Korean film of all time. Through the movie, we see how the efforts of one taxi driver -- played by the always enjoyable Song Kang-ho -- and a relentless German journalist, that Korea's May 18 Democratic Uprising, where hundreds were killed while protesting the military government, became known to the world.'I Can Speak,ï'directed by Kim Hyeon-suk, also deals with Korea's lingering pain from history. The elderly Na Ok-boon (Na Moon-hee) is a neighborhood busybody who pesters civil servant Park Min-jae (Lee Je-hoon) for English lessons. It turns out that Na was forced into military sexual slavery in her youth by the Japanese. By learning English, she exposes Japan's crimes on the international stage. Spectacular computer graphics Ryoo Seung-wan's 'The Battleship Islandï'recreated almost in its entirety Japan's Hashima Island, where Korean people were forced into slave labor by the Japanese, both using a set and through computer graphics. The film shows large-scale explosions in the narrow underground coal mines, Korean laborersï'decrepit living conditions and a rebellion that breaks out among the workers. ã€€Kim Yong-hwa's 'Along with the Gods: The Two Worldsï'offered another example of sheer scale and spectacle. It created a vast fantasy world of the afterlife, from the burning hell of lava to sprawling deserts and towering waterfalls. The graphics were undertaken by Kim's Dexter Studios, one of Asia's leading motion picture production studios. Daring films that attempted to transcend genre Director Lee Sa-rang's 'Real,ï'starring Kim Soo-hyun, caused a small sensation when it was released in June. With blaring electronic visuals (so much red lighting), a plot that attempted to intertwine the present, the past, the psyche, and reality, and explicit sex scenes, the film was incomprehensible and utterly new -- though perhaps not in the best way. It is worth noting for its courage in breaking all the rules.Shin Su-won's 'Glass Gardenï'features a scientist (Moon Geun-young) who isolates herself in the forest in order to research blood. She discovers a way to create 'green bloodï'by infusing blood with chloroplasts, and dreams of one day turning into a tree. The novelty of the premise led it to open this year's Busan International Film Festival.

"223","Is second Korean War imminent? [Q&As]",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"April","Is second Korean War imminent? [Q&As]  Korea Times April 11, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesApril 11, 2017 TuesdayIs second Korean War imminent? [Q&As]BYLINE: By Digital News TeamLENGTH: 1450 wordsWill North Korea conduct a nuclear test in coming days? And will the United States punish it with a military strike, as Donald Trump pledged as one of the options to curb the North's nuclear ambitions?Any military clash between the two countries could lead to the worst-case scenario of a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula.Many South Koreans are increasingly uneasy about possible exchanges of fire -- between the two Koreas or a three-way battle involving a third country, most likely the U.S. -- that could throw their lives into unprecedented chaos. The unplanned deployment of a U.S. carrier strike group to waters close to the peninsula has stoked worries. Adding fuel to the fire are widespread 'warmongering rumors' on the internet, with detailed prospects, including when and how a second Korean War would break out. Many experts and government officials called the rumors 'baseless,' but that seems to have done little to contain rising public anxiety.The Korea Times interviewed four experts on North Korea and international relations to draw up a likely scenario that will play out in coming days.A dominant prospect was that North Korea would make some form of provocation before or after the 105th anniversary of its founder Kim Il-sung's birthday, which falls on Saturday, but it would be non-nuclear -- possibly a ballistic missile launch -- so that the U.S. won't respond with a strike and the two Koreas would avoid a bloody head-on fight.Nevertheless, given the fact Trump is as unpredictable as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, it would be wise to say that things are still up in the air.Three questions were equally given to four experts: Prof. Kim Dong-yub of the Institute for Far Eastern Studies, Kyungnam University; Dr. Chung Sung-yoon of the Korea Institute for National Unification; Prof. KimJae-chun of Sogang University and Dr. Cheong Seong-chang, senior research fellow in the Unification Strategy Studies Program of the Sejong Institute.1. Kim Dong-yubKim Dong-yubQ. Do you think North Korea is likely to conduct a nuclear test before or after April 15?A. If North Korea conducts provocative action, the ballistic missile launch is the most likely. The possibility of the sixth nuclear test is very low. The nation takes those actions not to celebrate or commemorate a certain date, it does it by the change of domestic circumstance.Q. If a nuclear test takes place, do you think the United States will take any form of military action against North Korea? When? And how?A. That is a different problem. If the U.S. does react to North Korea's provocation, North Korea will retaliate against South Korea. This would seriously harm the Seoul-Washington alliance. Furthermore, expecting the neighboring countries' negative reactions to the attack, it is hard to anticipate that the U.S. will counter-attack North Korea.Q. What would be the most likely reaction to such a strike from North Korea, China and Japan? Please be specific.A. A justifying reason for the attack, such as crimes against humanity, would make the U.S. attack North Korea. But when there is no justification, it would cause an uncontrollable result. There would be a big retaliation action from North Korea, and then the South Korean public's reaction towards the U.S. will deteriorate, which will threaten the South Korea-U.S. military alliance enormously.2. Chung Sung-yoonChung Sung-yoonQ. Do you think North Korea is likely to conduct a nuclear test before or after April 15?A. The nuclear test is unlikely to happen, but military provocation is highly expected. North Korea conducts provocative measures under two conditions: a) when there is a necessity and b) when there is any political and diplomatic interest for them. Currently, it needs to confirm how much its ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) and SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile) have improved, and react firmly to the U.S.'s suppressive counter-North Korean policies. Considering the time needed for the preparation, North Korea's military provocation will happen at least one to two months later.Q. If a nuclear test takes place, do you think the United States will take any form of military action against North Korea? When? And how?A. The U.S. taking a firm stance against North Korea and attacking the nation are two different problems. It is evident that Trump is considering taking military sanctions as one of the options, but there lies a greater risk of 'war escalation in the Korean Peninsula,' which makes it difficult for the U.S. to do any military action.Q. What would be the most likely reaction to such a strike from North Korea, China and Japan? Please be specific.A. It will be differed by the time and the purpose, but if the U.S. really does attack, in a very low possibility, it is clear that the nation should have already prepared for the war escalation to have a 'War Escalation Dominance Strategy.'3. Kim Jae-chunKim Jae-chunQ. Do you think North Korea is likely to conduct a nuclear test before or after April 15?A. North Korea must be scratching its head hard. It wants to send messages to the world that it will stick to its own path despite mounting pressure from the U.S. and the global community. But it should be a pressing matter on North Korea to see its relations with the U.S. tarnishing to something irrevocable, given the military state conducts the sixth nuclear test. North Korea might be taking into account that the test could raise eyebrows on South Korea's progressive presidential election candidates such as Moon Jae-in. The sixth test, on North Korea's part, must demonstrate the state's ability to control hydrogen bombs, not atomic bombs, and have skills to minimize and standardize its nuclear weapons. North Korea will conduct the sixth test, whether April or not, because it never wants to give up its 'nuclear-armed country' brand. If the test was done this month, it will be around the 15th.Q. If a nuclear test takes place, do you think the United States will take any form of military action against North Korea? When? And how?A. The U.S. will not throw a preemptive military strike at North Korea. But if it does, North Korea will retaliate by attacking South Korea. The U.S., allied with South Korea, is responsible for taking part in an inter-Korean military clash, which it wishes to avoid. The U.S., if it has to, would rather put stronger pressure on North Korea by activating DEFCON (Defense Readiness Condition) than waging a military war on the state.Q. What would be the most likely reaction to such a strike from North Korea, China and Japan? Please be specific.A. North Korea will be easily provoked and retaliate strongly in any fashion. China will not approve of America attacking North Korea. Japan has no choice but to ready itself for a semi-war stance because it knows it could be targeted by North Korean retaliation.4. Cheong Seong-changCheong Seong-changQ. Do you think North Korea is likely to conduct a nuclear test before or after April 15?A. It is possible that, with signs of North Korea's sixth nuclear test being detected, the test will be conducted before Apr. 25, the foundation date of the People's Army. The website 38 North estimated that North Korea's fifth test carried explosive power of 15,000-20,000 tons. It is expected the sixth test will carry the power of at least 14 times that of its previous test.Q. If a nuclear test takes place, do you think the United States will take any form of military action against North Korea? When? And how?A. Given North Korea carries out the sixth nuclear test, the U.S. will push for stronger anti-North Korean measures at the U.N. Security Council, including a secondary boycott and moving its strategic nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. could also throw a precision strike at Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center to prevent North Korea's further advancement of nuclear capability.Q. What would be the most likely reaction to such a strike from North Korea, China and Japan? Please be specific.A. If the U.S. attacks the Yongbyon facility, it will open the curtains to the worst-case scenario -- nuclear war -- as North Korea could attack South Korea's nuclear plants or Seoul using nuclear weapons. China would certainly disagree with the U.S. attacking North Korea. China would withhold its engagement in the military conflict as long as the Kim Jong-un regime does not collapse so that it does not have to clash with the U.S. Japan will support the U.S. in attacking North Korea because it needs American support as it tries to beef up its imperial military force.Park Si-soo, Ko Dong-hwan, Eom Da-sol, Woo Ji-won, Lee Han-soo contributed to this article.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS (90%); MILITARY OPERATIONS (90%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); ANNIVERSARIES (76%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (67%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%); ETHNIC & CULTURAL STUDIES (62%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (78%); KIM JONG UN (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (77%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (97%); UNITED STATES (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: April 11, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"224","Multiracial students to get boost",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"March","Multiracial students to get boost  Korea Times March 8, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesMarch 8, 2017 WednesdayMultiracial students to get boostBYLINE: By Kim Bo-eunLENGTH: 470 wordsThe Ministry of Education said Wednesday it will extend support for the growing number of multiracial students, by designating schools to help them develop their language skills.'The ministry will designate areas with large numbers of multiracial students as special global education zones,' Education Minister Lee Joon-sik said in a briefing, at the Seoul Government Complex.Schools with a high proportion of multiracial students will be designated as pilot schools for foreign language education and will have autonomy in drawing up and running their curricula.The measure comes as part of comprehensive plans to narrow the education disparity between income groups.A household survey conducted last year showed households with a monthly income of 6 million won and above spent over 10 times more on children's education than households earning less than 1 million won a month.'A distinct gap exists between income groups in entering university, which lasts in landing jobs and ultimately in income,' Lee said.Among those in need of assistance are a growing number of multiracial children who have difficulty adjusting to school due to the language barrier, cultural differences and social prejudice - which in many cases leads to dropouts.According to ministry data, the dropout rate of multiracial students in 2015 was 0.85 percent, which is higher than that of Korean students at 0.77 percent.The students cited difficulty getting along with other students as the biggest reason (64.7 percent), but the second most widely cited one was that they were unable to adjust to their studies (45.2 percent), according to a survey by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family last year.Schools with large numbers of multiracial students are sometimes shunned by teachers and in some cases Korean students transfer to other schools due to difficulty in the classroom in getting multiracial students engaged.As a means to tackle this problem, the ministry said it will increase the number of kindergartens for multiracial children teaching Korean language and fundamental academic skills from the current 60 in 12 cities and provinces to 90 in 17 cities and provinces across the nation.The ministry will develop a manual for the kindergartens and distribute them by February next year.It will also expand the number of classes for children and teenagers who come to Korea after growing up abroad. The classes will teach Korean language and culture to help them adjust to school here.Students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies will start providing mentoring in the children's mother tongue.Since the only law related to education for multiracial children is on the process for school transfers, the ministry is reviewing setting up a separate law or making revisions to existing ones to establish legal grounds for its plan.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (91%); CHILDREN (90%); STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS (90%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (89%); COLLEGE STUDENTS (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); EDUCATION LAW (78%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); CURRICULA (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (78%); SCHOOL DROP OUTS (78%); HOUSEHOLD NUMBERS (77%); POLLS & SURVEYS (76%); PERSONAL & FAMILY INCOME (75%); GENDER EQUALITY (70%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: March 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

That it is extremely unnatural and dangerous to drag people along by orders of a single individual or of a few is all too well proven by the misfortunes that befell Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.' - Kim Koo (1876-1949), 'My Wish'A 'chinilpa' (collaborationist with Imperial Japan) he wasn't. Neither was he especially fond of the monarchy which antedated Japan's stealthy routing of Korea, having been judged to be a member of a less-favored 'commoner' (sangmin) class.Furthermore, he never became ppalgaengi (communist), pro-communist, 'pro-North' (jongbuk) or fascist -- as some have snobbishly, dubiously and rather lazily claimed.What Kim Koo most certainly was, beyond being a product of harsh circumstances and an impossibly tumultuous and convoluted period: an earnest patriot who thoroughly loved Korea and its people, a tireless advocate for his nation's 'full and complete independence,' and a work-in-progress (hence problematic to judge).After the unscrupulous and catastrophic decision by two competing empires to divvy up the country -- scorning basic humanitarian principles and expert warnings explicitly indicating it would lead to unprecedented crises for Koreans, including war -- Kim promptly became a redoubtable voice espousing 'unification now.' He labored until his death to avert the impending proxy war between the freshly-fractured, hastily-forming, mutually-antagonistic and ideologically-incompatible states, for which the stage was being set.A former State Department official -- regarded as one of the only US 'Korea experts' of the period - stressed for a 1950 report, 'Since the 38-degree line was not only without any topographic basis, but also without any foundation in previous political and economic fact as well, the division amounted in reality to the vivisection of Korea.'A heartrending plea for unity published a year before Kim Koo's ruthless assassination at the Korean age of 74, dispels libelous myths surrounding a fabricated 'true agenda' or malevolent character. Stereotypically ignoble distortions, heedlessly jumbled into a ghastly caricature, fed a narrative or theory by careerist historians dependent upon strikingly dubious sources (typically secondhand accounts from his 'pro-Japaneseï'political enemies). Wildly inaccurate depictions have been spread -- replete with an air of historiographical authority -- as 'history.ï'A brutish and not-quite-human contortion of Kim Koo's person has been incautiously recycled through a string of books on Korea.'Entreaty to My 30 Million Compatriots,ï'written in 1948, may be a helpful brisk-read for those who wish to understand the man and his actual disposition - such as his straightforward hunger for peace and unity within Korea and predilection for democratic principles, also evident in other writings such as his 1947 statement of political philosophy titled 'My Wish.'In the 1948 statement, Kim Koo advised reevaluating the term 'liberationï'as applied to Aug. 15, 1945, as the era of 'freedom we had awaited instead divided our territory, ushering in the peril that the Korean Peninsula may be eternally separated into two countries.ï'He endorsed instituting an alternative conception which more precisely encapsulates the meaning of Aug. 15 for Korea.Baekbeom (Kim Koo's pen name, roughly meaning 'common person') pleaded for the ending of trivial conflicts amongst Koreans of every background and political propensity, exhorting, 'Let's stop internal fights completely! There is an adage: 'A little impatience spoils great plans.ï'We must proceed onward from past affairs and, with inner resolve, tolerate one another.'For his instrumental role in promoting harmony within the Korean independence movement, Baekbeom is oft-commended and cited by Koreans, both left-leaning and right-leaning, and is consistently named among the most popular figures in Korean history. Consequently, his legacy is among the most misappropriated -- some in Korea have labeled him maximally 'leftist,ï'some outside of Korea extreme 'rightist,ï'while those who prize objectivity and have circumspectly examined the matter may be inclined to describe him, at least at the end, as a moderate or centrist. The Kim dynasty despots have also sought, most contemptibly, to capitalize on his atypical fame via a menagerie of infantile, wretched and elaborate fiction.ã€€ Baekbeom ardently implored for the total and unconditional halting of politically-motivated violence within the entreaty, urgently appealing to the conscience of his people. He pled, 'For once, let's strive to forget about what is past. Do not be suspicious of one another and do not slander. Rather, we must appeal to each other's true patriotism! Assassinations and destructiveness ... would only, in the end, impede our country's emancipation. Let's cease quarreling furiously amongst ourselves and cooperate with one another by way of a generous and warm heart!'Poignantly, Kim Koo went on to express admiration for Gandhi who, it is believed, was able to pardon his assassin even while dying. He confessed, 'I recently learned from Mahatma Gandhi. He is said to have placed his hand upon his forehead at the instant of being shot by an assassin, remembering to practice the virtue of forgiveness. I've known comparable ordeals such as being sentenced to death, and have been shot. Yet I'm ashamed to admit, at that time I lacked the courage to forgive my enemies. I'm quite embarrassed by my former inability to forgive, even now.'Then, what would Baekbeom counsel respecting Korea's present situation?For one, those who brush aside mass atrocities which have been and continue to be perpetrated against Korea's most helpless and defenseless populations within the North -- political prisoners who are entirely innocent, including thousands of children systematically starved, brutalized and forced to do slave labor unremittingly - are committing a grave error with severe implications. Baekbeom would have never condoned such callousness.In the entreaty, Kim Koo conveyed a tearful sense of foreboding and unadulterated compassion toward his compatriots north of the 38th Parallel, stating, 'Before I die, I want to see those who are from the north able to freely return home. When suffering difficult days, it seems I can hear the wailing of ghosts in the vicinity of the 38th Parallel. While sitting alone in the tranquil night, the reproachful and unhappy faces of poverty-stricken and starving compatriots of south and north seem to appear before me.'The citation at this article's onset from My Wish establishes that Baekbeom would have been frankly aghast by the totalitarian prison North Korea has become; a genocidal system of sheer exploitation with pronounced similarities to fascist-era Japan, in terms of mechanisms and modes of oppression, as well as in the deification and compulsory religious worship of what is generally regarded anathema to communism -- hereditary dictatorship. Even a 1970 book issued by Pyongyang, preceding Kim Jong-il's designation as his father's successor, denounced hereditary succession as a 'reactionary custom of exploitative systems of the old days.ï'By 1972 that bit was deleted from the North's 'Political Dictionary.'Baekbeom would likewise be repulsed by the Kim dynasty's discriminatory ways, which would evoke hardships he faced as a young man graded sangmin. Yet clearly, the Kim despots are architects of oppression unfathomably more heartless.Independent law firm Hogan Lovells determined the Kim dynasty's murderous maltreatment, over decades, of many millions of Korea's people cursed and condemned by the tyrants as comprising a 'hostile classï'not solely transgressed the legal threshold for crimes against humanity, but also genocide.

So we aimed to make a creative space where children were able to draw pictures and create an area of their own.'Geumho renovated a total of six classrooms, which incorporated sofas and a beehive structure where students were able to read books; and for the smaller classrooms, an attic area, and a slide for the bigger ones.Students welcomed the renovations completed last month.'I like the attic, slide and doodle board,' said Lee Seo-yoon, a first grader.'It is nice that the classroom changed in the way we drew pictures of them.'Parents also showed a favorable response.'Parents are most concerned about their child's adjustment when entering elementary school,' Lee Jeong-im, a parent of a first-grader, said.'It is great that the school now has classrooms that are designed for play-based education.'She also commented on seasonal and weather-based circumstances which limit children from outdoor play.'I am happy that now they are able to relieve their stress and release their energy in the classroom regardless of such circumstances,' Lim said.The response was alike for teachers, but they also face a greater challenge in maintaining safety and order.'Due to the new features, teachers face a greater need for discipline inside the classroom _ such as having to limit the time students are able to access the play area, and teach rules and manners when it comes to using the slide and doodle board,' said Gyong Gyu-ran, a first-grade teacher.Meanwhile, the SMOE plans to continue efforts to renovate classrooms.'We will continue projects to improve the learning environment for students and through innovation of spaces at schools, we hope the classes will encourage greater student participation and cooperation,' SMOE Superintendent Cho Hee-yeon said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIMARY SCHOOLS (92%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (92%); BUILDING RENOVATION (90%); CHILDREN (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); CITY LIFE (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); CITIES (78%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES (78%); OFFICE DESIGN (78%); URBAN SCHOOLS (78%); CURRICULA (78%); HOMEWORK (78%); TRENDS (76%); DRAWING & ILLUSTRATION (74%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (57%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: November 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

You Sung-yop, second from right, chief of the National Assembly's Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee, exits a hall after a dispute with Rep. Yeom Dong-yeol of the Liberty Korea Party on a state-authored textbook plan at the education ministry's audit held at the Sejong Government Complex on Oct. 13. The ministry a day earlier requested the prosecution to investigate allegations that Cheong Wa Dae manipulated public opinion on the textbook plan. YonhapMinistry requests probe into alleged forging of public opinion formsThe National Assembly's education committee had to adjourn its audit of the education ministry, late Thursday, to prevent an escalating dispute from developing into a physical scuffle.The dispute centered on allegations that Cheong Wae Dae and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) manipulated and falsified public opinion in favor of the disputed plan to replace existing history textbooks with one authored by the government under the Park Geun-hye administration.Ruling party lawmakers called for a thorough investigation into the allegations, while opposition members said the committee looking into the case was biased and that inspections needed to be conducted into opinions against the plan as well.Last week, the education ministry requested investigators look into the case.State-authored textbook planFormer President Park had remarked about the importance of 'having a proper spirit' based on 'the correct learning of history,' as the grounds for the plan to introduce a single, government-authored history textbook.Liberal historians, educators and lawmakers denounced the plan, stating it was an attempt to impose a uniform conservative view of history, based on the Park administration's political inclination.Some accused the plan of being Park's attempt to glorify the achievements of her father, former President Park Chung-hee, while downplaying the human rights violations that occurred under his authoritarian rule.But the book was published in January and set to be used at schools beginning in the spring semester this year.Following vows of many education offices nationwide that they would not cooperate, the ministry revised its plan so schools could choose between the state-authored text or a privately published one in 2018, while having schools use the books on a voluntary basis this year.However, even this plan failed, as only one school ended up as a participant in the pilot program _ Munmyeong High School in Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province. But even this school was eventually barred from using the book due to a suit filed by parents of the students.After President Park was impeached, the plan lost further impetus, and with the inauguration of the Moon Jae-in administration it was officially scrapped.The Moon administration established an investigation committee last month to conduct an inspection into how the plan was conducted.Allegations of opinion manipulationAhead of the introduction of the plan to publish a single government-authored history textbook for middle and high schools, the ministry had conducted a public opinion survey and unveiled the results in November 2015.Although the people against the plan more than doubled those supporting it, the then-opposition New Politics Alliance for Democracy and a media outlet had raised allegations that large numbers of opinion forms in favor of the plan had been printed out at the same printing station on Yeouido, Seoul.The investigation committee confirmed 53 out of 103 boxes of opinion forms for and against the plan contained thousands of pages of the same form.An inspection of 26 boxes showed they carried large numbers of four types of forms, which repeatedly stated the same reasons for supporting the textbook plan.Hundreds of forms were found to have been submitted under a single name. Only 4,374 forms met the requirements but 1,613 of the people supporting the plan had the same address.Some of the forms were submitted with names such as Lee Wan-yong, the pro-Japanese collaborator under Japan's 1910-45 occupation of Korea, former President Park Chung-hee or Park Geun-hye. Others were submitted under absurd and obscene names, such as Korean words for 'barking' and 'lunacy.'Among the 4,374 people who submitted the forms, the committee randomly called 677, 252 of which responded.Among them, 51 percent acknowledged they submitted the form, while 25 percent said they had not, and others said they did not remember.Evidence shows this was not merely a prank, but allegedly a government-backed effort.At the National Assembly audit in November 2015, then-Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea said, 'On the last day of the opinion collection period, a ministry official received notification and around 50 boxes arrived later in the night.'Ministry officials said they received an order from an upper-level official to make people stay to count the forms that would arrive and add them to the tallied number.The investigation committee said it received a tip-off that a professor at Sungkyunkwan University surnamed Yang had played a central role in creating the forged opinion forms.Last week, the education ministry submitted a request to the prosecution to investigate the allegations.Those subject to investigations are Yang, an upper-level ministry official and a group of parents. They face charges of forging documents and thereby obstructing the execution of public duty, as well as unauthorized use of others' private information.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INVESTIGATIONS (91%); TEXTBOOKS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (89%); HISTORY (89%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); PUBLISHING (77%); INSPECTIONS (77%); HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW (77%); LITIGATION (76%); CONSERVATISM (73%); IMPEACHMENT (73%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (71%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (68%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (54%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%); MOON JAE-IN (79%)LOAD-DATE: October 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

As only Latvia among the Baltic States -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- has an embassy in Korea, the diplomatic mission organized a tourism promotion seminar in Seoul on May 15, where some 20 public tourism officials and numerous other travel company representatives participated. ??By promoting ourselves together as an integrated destination, we can consolidate our strengths and make ourselves more attractive to tourists,?? Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars told The Korea Herald in a separate interview at the embassy. ??Everything starts from an initial contact, which leads to better knowledge of each other and creation of durable links. Slowly but steadily, the number of Koreans visiting the Baltics is growing, roughly 10,000 annually.??To introduce the Baltic Year 2018 celebrations, the embassy is putting all efforts to strengthen tourism between Korea and the Baltic states, giving lectures at schools, universities and cultural organizations, as well as engaging with the media and participating in international events, the envoy added.The embassy, which recently relocated near Hangangjin Station in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, has produced a Baltic travel map with information on popular and hidden spots in Korean. The three nations are part of the Schengen Area: a zone comprising 26 European states that have abolished passport and border control at their mutual borders to encourage unrestricted travel. No visas are required to travel across the three countries for Koreans. The three states all use the euro currency. Riga is the largest city in any of the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia??s 2 million people. The Latvian capital has well-preserved architecture dating back to the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname ??the Pearl of the Baltic Sea.?? Designated the European Cultural Capital in 2014, it has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world. The capital??s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its many buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The city offers a myriad of festivals and performing arts throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet concerts and art exhibitions. Major events for next year are Lattelcom Riga Marathon in May, Riga Opera Festival in June, Riga City Festival in August and Staro Riga light festival in November. Estonia offers urban attractions, ecotourism and picturesque islands, among others. There are over 190 nationalities residing in the country of 1.3 million people, more than two-thirds of whom are Estonian. Most travelers spend the bulk of their time in Tallinn, which offers rich cultural and historical heritage, shopping venues, scenic beaches, spas, saunas and delectable cuisine. Other popular cities are Narva and Tartu, famous for architecture, wellness, nature and theater. Lithuania has a population of 3 million, and its capital is Vilnius. The country offers safe and secure tourism, unadulterated natural landscape, rich historical heritage, fast internet and ease of communication for foreigners, according to its State Department of Tourism. Vilnius has modernist buildings in Kaunaus and medieval capital Kernave, both included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. Historic city and lake resort Trakai, Baltic coastal city Klaipeda and the Hill of the Crosses are also popular.??Having emerged as independent states from the ashes of the First World War, the three Baltic countries share a common geographical, historical and cultural mentality,?? the ambassador explained, adding the region was under German, Swedish and Polish rule before the liberation. ??We understand that we can be more attractive when we are united. That??s why we all joined the European Union, eurozone, Schengen Area as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It??s important for us to be cooperating under the current volatile international situations and be part of these organizations. We also collaborate in step within the EU to have more attraction.??Strong mechanisms for cooperation exist for the Baltic States regarding EU matters, and they try to formulate similar or common positions to punch above their weight in global affairs, the diplomat added. He also said the three countries now operate many intercultural and economic linkages with one another, and compete in a ??positive and healthy way?? to spur growth and innovation.??There is positive competition between us that leads to healthy growth,?? according to Vaivars. ??We turn our eyes and ears to what is going on around us and envy any progress made by another neighbor. For example, if Estonia made strides in information communications and electronic government, Latvia wants to copy that and improve its own systems.??Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia regularly organize Baltic ministers?? meetings and interparliamentary meetings, as well as the ??3+5?? Baltic plus Nordic cooperation channels and Council of the Baltic Sea States assemblies. The Baltics are similar in many ways to the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, and consider themselves to be Nordic, the envoy said. ??The distance between Nordic and Baltic countries is getting shorter. My hope is that one day there won??t be any division between the Baltics and Nordics and there will be just Nordic countries. Another way to think of us is to look at the ??Benelux?? political and economic union of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.??Latvia, similar to its Baltic neighbors, was in dire straits with no governmental institutions and market economy following its liberation from the Soviet Union in 1991.??Latvia was the 10th richest country in Europe in 1939, but over 50 years of Soviet rule did huge damage to our economy,?? the ambassador stressed. ??Particularly as we feel more and more threats from our neighboring country Russia, we feel that the decisions that we made immediately after our independence in the early 1990s -- joining the strategic organizations EU and NATO -- were absolutely right.??Through the last 25 years, large differences were accrued and can be observed in countries that didn??t join these organizations, he added, noting they have developed economically at a slower pace and achieved little in reforms, while facing greater Russian influences in internal affairs.Highlighting that early exchanges through tourism will spark mutual interest and eventually lead to greater economic cooperation, Vaivars pointed to Latvia??s strengths in the wood and timber, furniture and interior design, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, cosmetics and fashion industries, with Korea being the second-largest export market in Asia, after China.The delegation at the maiden tourism seminar in May included officials from the Riga Tourism Development Bureau, Baltic Travel Group, Con-ex Latvia Tours Group and Estravel Latvia. The event was supported by Finnair, Lufthansa, Korea Tourism Organization, Korean Association of Travel Agents and Seoul Tourism Organization.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (90%); INTERNATIONAL TOURISM (90%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (89%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (89%); FESTIVALS (89%); HISTORIC SITES (89%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (87%); ARCHITECTURE (86%); DESTINATIONS & ATTRACTIONS (78%); ECOTOURISM (78%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (78%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (78%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (78%); TOURISM (78%); TRAVEL AGENTS (73%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); HISTORIC DISTRICTS & STRUCTURES (68%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (66%); BORDER CONTROL (64%); BALLET (60%); OPERA (60%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (52%); EURO (50%)CITY: RIGA, LATVIA (94%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); TALLINN, ESTONIA (79%)STATE: ATLANTIC OCEAN (78%)COUNTRY: BALTIC STATES (99%); NORTHERN ASIA (96%); LATVIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); EUROPE (93%); NORTHERN EUROPE (92%); ESTONIA (90%); LITHUANIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: June 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"229",NA,NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"November","Finding humanity in design   THE KOREA HERALD November 1, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDNovember 1, 2017 WednesdayFinding humanity in design LENGTH: 1465 wordsIn an age where design permeates all industries and all aspects of life, this year's Herald Design Forum questions the role humanity plays in it.At the forum's first session, set to take place Tuesday at 9:20 a.m. at The Shilla Seoul's Dynasty Hall, three global designers will expound on their approach to design.The designers spoke with The Korea Herald prior to the event to answer questions on the fundamental meaning of design and its lasting value. -- Ed.Experimenting without restrictions: Jaime HayonSpanish artist and designer Jaime Hayon served as the design department director at the Benetton-funded Italian design academy Fabrica until 2003. Hayon has since launched his own practice, Hayon Studio, dedicated to projects that range from art installations and interior design to product design. In the following edited excerpts, Hayon answers questions on where the value of design can be found: Is it in functionality, commerciality or in some more fundamental, personal aspect? Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? ã€€A: Value comes from what we cherish most. In many cases it may be about exclusivity or quality but in others it is about the power to communicate an idea. Art is a platform in which the creator can be truly free to let imagination take over. The productivity, the financials and the formal considerations that industrial design require, are not that important in art. I am passionate about experimenting without restrictions. My ideal type of work is trying something new: new shapes, new materials, new methods. Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead the global design industry trend?A: I think individuals with a strong sense of identity, who have something more to bring to the table aside from function, will be leading the design industry. The evolution of the way we live our lives requires objects to transmit emotions and make us feel.Q: You recently founded clothing brand Jijibaba. Fashion brands often expand to furniture or interior design, but it is rare to see moves in the opposite direction. Why did you decide to enter the fashion industry? ã€€A: Exactly because of this: It was very rare. It is a new exercise that opens a new door where I can explore creativity from a new perspective. Being it is a non-conventional approach, it can bring a fresh vision to this field. It has been a very interesting opportunity and I have made good use of my ideas and intuition in a whole different sphere of work.ã€€Q: The Internet of Things is at the center of the 'fourth industrial revolution.ï'At this point, what role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A: I can't judge the entire role of design but I can see the need for design to create an emotional link with its user increases. The internet brought on a totally new way to live our lives, making many things easier and many others more difficult. The sense of closeness being essential to us more now than ever, there are definitively new things to consider regarding design and its role.Specialness of normality: Naoto FukasawaNaoto Fukasawa, the famed Japanese industrial designer behind lifestyle brand Muji's wall-mounted CD player, says he finds creativity in what are considered everyday things. Q: Your design philosophy is 'supernormal.ï'Does that refer to something that is special because it is normal, or something that is the 'most normalï'among all normal things?A: I think my take on 'supernormalï'is about finding or reaching archetypes, or basic patterns that can be reused. Because archetypes are so simple yet so difficult to find, when we reach it, it becomes indispensable. This is what 'supernormalï'means to me. Q: People describe your work as simple and dry, identifying it with the Japanese brand Muji. When did you start preferring designs that are 'special because they are normalï'over flashier ones? ã€€A: I think I have always been looking for archetypes. This part of me has never changed. Of course, as a young designer I was influenced by different movements as well. It takes a long time to realize what is truly 'you.ï'Every artist faces this and it is a lifelong search. But I see only a few other designers who look for archetypes.Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? What is your ideal type of artwork?A: We hesitate to demolish old buildings to build new ones in cities. We award an emotional value to long-lasting city scenes. It is more obvious in Europe where municipals support and protect old buildings. There is a part of human desire that wishes to control and design nature -- we take natural settings and redesign them to build wineries or resorts. I think I can understand it. But I would personally like to design a house where people can look for their own peace. Q: Do you recall a memorable Korean design?A: There are two changes I recall which came from South Korea. The first one is global leadership in the TV industry. South Korean TV manufacturing has taken global leadership and today when we think of TV, we think of your brands.The second is Kia. I remember when German automobile designer Peter Schreyer became the chief designer for Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors. Since that moment, Kia's design has changed significantly.Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead the global design industry trend?A: I think people or organizations that create our living platforms have the power to shift our world. Such organizations have the potential to make a paradigm shift. In many organizations of such kind, they use the term 'campusï'for their office, which has a sense of collectiveness. It communicates the fact that people are gathered in the environment because of their willingness and passion. Encasing the memory of Venice in a table -- Claudio BelliniItalian-born architect-designer Claudio Bellini is the founder and current head of Claudio Bellini Design+Design, recognized as one of the most influential studios worldwide. Bellini has been directing the development of new products for Korean furniture maker Fursys Group since 2010. Q: The Internet of Things is at the center of the 'fourth industrial revolution.ï'At this point, what role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A: We are our artifacts. Since a long time ago, our objects have been the representation of our social and cultural evolution, our research on perfection and beauty. That principle is still the same and will remain the same, but will be projected on a completely different scale because of a new context, characterized by a mix of cultures and different heritages playing together.Of course interaction with our objects is getting now more powerful, sophisticated and intimate because of their intelligence.Q: In your opinion, what is design that gains value over time? What is your ideal type of artwork?A: Time is the only judge. Many unpredictable, different reasons contribute to creating a 'classic.ï'Every time that happens, we recognize how that design deeply affects the collective imagination, independent from its practical use or function but based on its symbolic and iconic value. I rarely have the freedom to work in a poetic dimension, but with an Italian client of mine -- Riva 1920 -- I developed a piece of design I really love because there is a unique story behind it that brings emotion.The product is a console table called Venice, and it reuses a briccola wood tree trunk, used in the Venice lagoon to moor the gondolas. The final composition gives the old briccola a second life, reproducing how it used to be on the sea. The symbolic value of that memory is what makes this project unique.People are traveling more and more. I would love to work around this theme, investigating how to design the space of the temporary moving experience, including the interiors of trains and airplanes.Q: Based on your experience with Korean furniture makers iLoom and Bentek Furniture, what are some strengths and weaknesses of designs by Korean companies?A: When working with foreign companies in the area of domestic furniture, the more delicate issue (is) the different lifestyle heritage, which forces the designer and the client to invest lots of time in fine-tuning briefings.The finishes and materials are also, unfortunately, quite derivative compared to the European standard. On the other hand, based on my experience with a company like iLoom over the last five years, there is a great energy and determination to improve their capability in order to achieve a very high design quality.(doo@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CLOTHING LABELS (78%); INTERIOR DECORATING (78%); FASHION & APPAREL (76%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (75%); INDUSTRY TRENDS (73%); VISUAL ARTISTS (70%); TRENDS (50%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)LOAD-DATE: November 1, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"230","Gyeonggi rebrands English Village as Change Up Campus",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"October","Gyeonggi rebrands English Village as Change Up Campus   THE KOREA HERALD October 17, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 17, 2017 TuesdayGyeonggi rebrands English Village as Change Up Campus LENGTH: 669 wordsGyeonggi English Village, which was South Korea's first residential English camp, has rebranded itself as Change Up Campus as part of efforts to nurture and promote high-quality and future-oriented education for students, according to the province Tuesday. The Change Up Campus, run by Gyeonggi Province, will provide programs designed to help students to better prepare for the coming 'fourth industrial revolution' on top of learning the English language, the province said. Marking the reopening, a forum was organized Tuesday by the province and the Gyeonggi Provincial Institute for Lifelong Learning, where five experts on the panel exchanged views on what kind of education Change Up Campus should strive to offer. Professor Shin Kwan-soo of Namseoul University, who obtained a Ph.D. in international education in the University of Southern California, said the programs should be based on 'creativity, collaboration, communication and critical thinking' in line with global educational standards. Creativity in education has often been associated with arts education, he went on, but it can be expanded to teaching students how to think creatively in various fields, he said. 'A great many business leaders think they were not born more creative than others, but were educated to be so,ï'he said, citing a study published in Harvard Business Review. Another participant Chang Jae-young, president of Royal Academy of Music Korea, cited the UK's art education where students must master at least one musical instrument until high school, as a successful model of teaching that needs to be adopted in the Change Up Campus. 'The UK and other developed countries in Europe emphasize the importance of art education since preschool,ï'Chang said. 'Here, we do have an art class in public schools, but it is rather treated separately among other subjects. But in the UK, arts instruction is integrated into math, science, foreign language and other subjects, allowing students to learn it in the context of everyday life,ï'Chang said. 'By doing so, creativity can thrive,ï'Chang added. With the launch of the new educational hub, the province should work in partnership with local communities and educational experts for the development of its programs, said Gyeonggi Province councilor Bae Soo-moon.The councilor said that the campus can provide classes run by apprentice teachers from the region's education colleges through partnership.'It's a win-win for everyone. With the partnership, the province can resolve the possible problem of insufficient supply of native English-speaking teachers, while apprentice teachers can effectively develop their teaching skills,ï'Bae said. Seoul National University of Education professor Hong Sun-ho, however, emphasized that the province should learn from its own experiences of running the English village business and prepare for more high-quality education options. 'We need to think about what to learn from the previous business model and what to work on to improve it. We need not only high-quality educational programs for students, but for teachers as well to run the programs more smoothly,ï'Hong said. 'Having good software is as important as having good hardware as part of the overall package,ï'Hong added.At the opening ceremony held two days earlier in Paju, Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil said that the remodeled campus 'combines evolution and innovationï'to provide a better learning opportunity to the next generations and that it would 'provide a model for the country's new education.ï'The new campus program provides classes for students including experimenting with drones, robotics, coding and 3-D printing, as well as language courses and mentoring, as part of a solution to help them learn arts, science and technology out of public schools, according to the province.By Bak Se-hwan (sh@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (89%); APPRENTICESHIPS & INTERNSHIPS (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (77%); ACADEMIC STANDARDS (72%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (72%); CONTINUING EDUCATION (72%); MUSIC (65%); MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS (65%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (56%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (71%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); ENGLAND (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (86%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (71%)LOAD-DATE: October 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"231","Understanding the North Korean regime",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"July","Understanding the North Korean regime  Korea Times July 14, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesJuly 14, 2017 FridayUnderstanding the North Korean regimeBYLINE: By Choi Yearn-hongLENGTH: 918 words'Understanding the North Korean Regime' by Atsuhito IsozakiI am anxious to read any book or monograph that will help me understand the incomprehensible North Korean regime. How many people in the world can understand the totalitarian country ruled by one family over 70 years since 1945? Under that family rule, many people have starved to death, as the government funded heavy arms development programs, from those for nuclear warheads to intercontinental missiles.The Woodrow Wilson Center released a monograph authored by one of its scholars, Atsuhito Isozaki, who is also affiliated with Keio University in Japan. His proposition is as follows: North Korea's military-first policy, set up by Kim Jong-il, is a necessary condition of the third-generation hereditary rule over North Korea. In addition to Kim Il-sung's Juche ideology, Kim Jong-il established the so-called Sungun policy that made possible the National Defense Commission and its chairman's control of North Korea ultimately. To validate his proposition, Atsuhito used North Korean primary resources, Japanese documents and South Korean reports and scholarly papers on North Korea. He seems to be a young promising scholar on North Korean affairs.It is interesting for Atsuhito to borrow fellow Japanese scholar Ayako Masuhara's model of personal rule in North Korea. According to the author, 'personal rule' was made possible by the North Korean Constitutional Amendment with the party-led military-first policy. Personal rule relies on state violence or violence by the state, and constant surveillance of people by the party cell leaders in all organizations, from elementary schools to colleges, collective farms and factories, military organizations, and towns and counties. The education and indoctrination of the Juche and Sungun ideologies of people, from young children to adults in all walks of life, have been shaping the North Korean regime for over 70 years, without the threats of a revolution or military coup d'etat.It seems that the Workers Party and the National Defense Commission rule the country. However, only the supreme leader rules both the party and the commission, which glorify the revolutionary bloodline as the most legitimate succession of power.I tend to agree with the personal rule, from Kim Il-sung to his son, Kim Jong-il, and then to his grandson, Kim Jong-un. However, I do not necessarily agree with the author's view of the Confucian tradition supporting the personal rule over three generations. Confucius never mentioned and justified the three-generation rule over such a long period of time. It may be true that the dark age of the Joseon Kingdom, the Japanese colonial rule over Korea, and the totalitarian rule by the Stalin-like dictatorship after the Liberation in 1945 did not provide a bright light to the North Korean people, so that they have been accepting the hereditary rule supported by the Workers Party and the National Defense Commission. Freedom of thought is not allowed, and complete control of mind continues. Freedom of travel is not allowed in North Korea, worse than in the Joseon Kingdom, in which people could freely move from town to another. North Korean people need a permit to travel outside of their hometown. Visiting Pyongyang is a celebratory experience of a lifetime to most country people. I heard that story from a North Korean defector and a movie director who settled in South Korea and who visited Washington last year.This research monograph emphasized the international situational factors that do not effectively regulate the North Korean nuclear program. They were ineffective. The United States and South Korea asked, relied and expected China's intervention in denuclearizing North Korea. However, China never intended to curb North Korea's nuclear ambition until most recently. I still have some doubts on China's role in this matter. The United States could not press North Korea due to its Middle East priority. South Korea had a wishful thinking on China's role to control North Korea's nuclear program but never plotted a regime change. The Washington Post editorials have advocated a regime change as the only solution to North Korea's nuclear development program.Atsuhito used North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun and monthly magazine Kulloja, among other materials, for his research paper. They are no doubt useful primary sources. However, North Korean daily and monthly publications are all propaganda materials. In this research work, I do not see much about North Korean defectors who witnessed the shaky ground of Kim Jong-un's power. The author claimed to have uses U.S. and Russian military documents that were disclosed after a certain time period, but I did not see those, either. I am sure that South Korean materials are more readily available from North Korean defectors, including high-level diplomats and government officials. In addition, Chinese information on North Korean affairs is now open to the outside world. I wonder whether the author used all the best available information for this research project.I hope more scholarly works will be done for the demise of North Korea, or at least regime change. Why? The North Korean regime has been committing crimes against humanity. I met one Columbia-educated historian who predicted the demise of North Korea in the next 30 years.

The minor opposition Bareun Party claimed his appointment is the start of a history war by the Moon Jae-in administration. The main opposition Liberty Korea Party called for a withdrawal of the appointment.Chu was one of the writers of a high school history textbook published in 2013 that allegedly contained some left-leaning descriptions of Korea after liberation from Japanese rule in 1945. The textbook stirred controversy because of some of its content regarding the founding of separate governments in 1948 on the Korean Peninsula.On May 10, 1948, general elections took place and Syngman Rhee was inaugurated as the first president of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Aug. 15 of the same year. In September 1948, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed with Kim Il-sung as its leader.Even though the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 recognized ROK as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, the textbook seemingly backs the legitimacy of the founding of the North Korean regime by stating that the South Korean government was recognized only in the territory south of the 38th parallel. This goes against education ministry guidelines for writing history textbooks, which urges writers to keep in line with the U.N.'s recognition. It also goes against the common thinking of many Koreans. The textbook includes some problematic contents that could be interpreted as praising the North's land reform and glorifying its founding Juche ideology.When the education ministry ordered a revision of some of the problematic parts, Chu and other writers refused to do so and filed a suit against the ministry to nullify the correction order.It is regrettable that another appointment of a high-level post has become controversial. In a media interview this week, Chu said the museum will shed light on parts of history that have been overlooked, such as the activities of the interim government based in China during the 1910-1945 Japanese occupation of Korea. Historians are entitled to their own views. But as museum director, Chu should be mindful not to let his own historical views get in the way of balanced management of the museum.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HISTORY (92%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); TEXTBOOKS (90%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); UNITED NATIONS (89%); WRITERS (89%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (89%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (78%); LIBERALISM (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); POLITICS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (74%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (73%); ELECTIONS (72%); SUITS & CLAIMS (72%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (72%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (69%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (66%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: November 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

'This movie took six years to get made, so after six years this is the beginning of getting there and feeling the reward and the love of an audience -- in this case the love of a jury and of a festival.'The victory gives immediate awards-season momentum to 'The Shape of Water,' the story of a mute young woman, played by Sally Hawkins, who falls for a mysterious sea creature being held at a high-security lab. Many viewers in Venice fell for the movie's audacious mix of genres: It's a monster movie, a Cold War thriller, social-issues drama and even, at times, a musical.Del Toro said his win was a vindication for monster movies, science fiction and other sometimes derided cinema genres.'This is a beautiful encouragement, a beautiful act of love, and I think it is something very necessary,' he told reporters. 'It's about time that we understand that you cannot only legitimize certain genresï'and not others.The 74th edition of the world's oldest film festival brought stars including Clooney, Matt Damon and Jennifer Lawrence to the canal-crossed Italian city's lush Lido island.Del Toro's film was one of several in the lineup that looked anxiously at humanity's treatment of the Earth and one another.Similar concerns showed up in the small-town rage depicted in Martin McDonagh's 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri'; in the spiritual agonies of Paul Schrader's eco-drama 'First Reformed'; in the migrants fleeing war, drought and hunger in Ai Weiwei's documentary 'Human Flow'; and in 'mother!ï'Darren Aronofsky's wild parable of Mother Earth under attack.The festival's runner-up Grand Jury Prize went to Israeli director Samuel Maoz's 'Foxtrot,ï'a compelling study of a family's grief and the way trauma echoes through the generations. Maoz, who won the Golden Lion in 2009 for his war film 'Lebanon,ï'has received some negative reaction in Israel because 'Foxtrotï'is critical of the army, the country's most respected institution.Maoz said no society could flourish when 'critics are considered to be traitors.'ã€€ 'If I criticize the place I live, I do it because I worry,ï'he said. 'I do it because I want to protect it. I do it from love.'France's Xavier Legrand was named best director for his first full-length film 'Custody,ï'which also won the festival's first-feature prize.Palestinian stage veteran Kamel El Basha was named best actor for Lebanese director Ziad Doueiri's drama 'The Insult.ï'Britain's Charlotte Rampling took the best actress prize for Andrea Pallaoro's film 'Hannah.'ã€€ Other winners included Warwick Thornton's Australian Western 'Sweet Country,ï'which won a Special Jury Prize, and McDonagh's 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,ï'which took the trophy for best screenplay.US actor Charlie Plummer, 18, was named best young performer for portraying a lonely boy who befriends a tired old racehorse in Andrew Haigh's 'Lean on Pete.'Italian director Susanna Nicchiarelli's 'Nico, 1988,ï'a biopic of the former Velvet Underground singer Nico, won the Horizons competition, which focuses on newer directors and edgier fare.Venice has a track record of launching films toward Hollywood awards success. This year's edition produced a crop of potential acting nominees, including Frances McDormand for 'Three Billboards,ï'Helen Mirren and Donald Sutherland for 'The Leisure Seekerï'and Lawrence for 'mother!'Venice's first prize for best virtual reality went to 'Arden's Wake,ï'a post-apocalyptic story by Eugene Y.K. Chung of the San Francisco-based startup Penrose.Chung said virtual reality 'is where film was 100 years ago, an emerging art form.''And it's going to be a real exciting journey,ï'he said.cap:Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro holds the Golden Lion award he received for his movie 'The Shape of Waterï'during the awards ceremony of the 74th annual Venice International Film Festival in Venice, Italy, Saturday.

So far, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, conductor Chung Myung-whun, POSCO Honorary Chairman Park Tae-joon and Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee are among the Koreans who have received the award.The insurer said the French government highly recognized Shin's contribution to the two countries' cultural exchange through the Daesan Foundation.The Daesan Foundation, established in 1992, is a non-profit cultural foundation to support writers and the translations of their works. So far, 510 literature pieces have been translated or published through the foundation and 310 were published outside Korea. One of those works was 'The Vegetarian' by Han Kang, which was translated by Deborah Smith and won the Man Booker International Prize last year.Shin has been the chairman of the foundation since 1993. Daesan is the pseudonym of Shin's father and the founder of Kyobo Life, Shin Yong-ho.Last year, Shin held a humanities lecture featuring 2008 Nobel Literature Prize winner Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio and renowned architect Dominique Perrault to commemorate the 130th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and France. The insurer said Kyobo Bookstore was also acknowledged for its contribution to the advancement of reading infrastructure in Korea. Kyobo Bookstore is one of the largest bookstore chains in Korea with 50 million Koreans visiting its stores across the country annualy. It also holds poetry readings, meetings with authors and other events that allow people to expand their interaction with literature.The insurer said that Shin has been expressing his affection for poetry and has been using its power during his business activities.'Shin usually quotes pieces of poems in his speeches to employees, in the belief that the poetic metaphor is more effective in delivering a message than lengthy words,' a Kyobo Life official said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INSURANCE (90%); LIFE INSURANCE (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (89%); POETRY (89%); AWARDS & PRIZES (89%); WRITERS (87%); BOOKSTORES (86%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); NOBEL PRIZES (77%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (77%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (77%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS (77%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (76%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (76%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (75%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (72%); UNITED NATIONS (72%); ANNIVERSARIES (71%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (67%)COMPANY: KYOBO LIFE INSURANCE CO LTD (84%); POSCO (57%); SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD (56%)TICKER: PKX (NYSE) (57%); PIDD (LSE) (57%); 5412 (TSE) (57%); 005490 (KSE) (57%); SMSN (LSE) (56%); 005930 (KSE) (56%)INDUSTRY: SIC6321 ACCIDENT & HEALTH INSURANCE (84%); SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE (84%); NAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWING (57%); NAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURING (57%); NAICS331110 IRON & STEEL MILLS & FERROALLOY MANUFACTURING (57%); NAICS334310 AUDIO & VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (56%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (56%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (56%)PERSON: LEE KUN-HEE (79%); BAN KI-MOON (57%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (72%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (96%); FRANCE (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: November 29, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Three others, including a father and his 7-year-old son, were on their way to the island where they hoped to start life anew.The following are their stories based on memories and information provided and compiled by their relatives and support groups.Portraits are shown of teachers at Danwon High School Yang Seung-jin and Go Chang-seok; students at Danwon High School Cho Eun-hwa, Heo Da-yun, Nam Hyun-cheol and Park Young-in; and passengers Lee Young-sook and Kwon Jae-geun and his son Hyeok-kyu. (People's Committee for the Sewol Ferry Tragedy)Yang Seung-jin, teacher at Danwon High School (57)Yang was last seen giving his life vest to a student and calling out to students to evacuate the ship. He then went to reach more students inside.These last actions reflected his personality as a caring teacher, colleague and husband. The 57-year-old social studies teacher was a strong person who could be depended on, recalled his co-workers and wife. Teaching for 30 years, his motto was pretty clear: to be responsible for them.He created a small orchard behind the school building to plant apple trees and Eastern prickly pear trees, where he would care for the trees with his students. He planned to create a scholarship for students lacking financial support with profits made from selling the fruit. His wife and two children, a daughter and a son, still await for their husband and father to return.Go Chang-seok, teacher at Danwon High School (40)Go always dressed in a suit and a tie and had his hair waxed at school. Some would say it was acceptable to wear gym clothes as a physical education teacher, but he refused to do so, regarding it as a serious subject.His students said they were not surprised to find out that he didn't swim out of the sinking ferry, even though he was a skilled swimmer with a lifesaving certification.A father of two young sons, now aged 11 and 9, he always made time for his family. He was also caring and romantic, sending bouquets of flowers to his wife's office for her birthday and anniversary every year.Cho Eun-hwa, student at Danwon High School (18)Cho was a straight-A student who received top scores on exams. She wanted to become an accountant. She was also a kind daughter who would never make her mother worry, her mother Lee Geum-hee said.Since Cho was lost in the cold sea in 2014, Lee and her husband have practically moved to Paengmok Port, the nearest point to the wreck site, to wait for her daughter to come back.""I am a grieving mother who is still living that day, begging for the life of my child,"" Lee said.Heo Da-yun, student at Danwon High School (18)Heo was a lively and warm-hearted student who wanted to become a kindergarten teacher. As a devout Christian, the 18-year-old would do volunteer work every week to look after children from multicultural families.She was mature enough to take care of her sick mother, who suffered from a rare disease, and never asked for anything that would burden her parents, her father recalled.Heo often met him at the subway station as her father home from work and loved to walk her dog Kkambi and go shopping with her older sister.Nam Hyun-cheol, student at Danwon High School (18)Nam was a talented musician and member of the school's vocal club. He could play the guitar well and wrote the lyrics for a song co-written with his friend, Lee Da-woon, another victim of the disaster. The song, ""My Dear Love,"" was later revised and released by ballad singer Shin Yong-jae. The profits from the song have been used to help the victims of the incident.Nam was a fourth-generation only son. His mother still remembers the first time she taught her son to shave. ""Those daily life episodes that were once trivial are left as some of the strongest memories for me now,"" she said.On Nam's guitar, his father wrote, ""My son. I am grateful and proud that you are my son. We love you forever, Please come back home.""Park Yeong-in, student at Danwon High School (18)Park was an athletic student and member of the school bowling club. He also had passion for soccer. Unlike some other teenager boys his age, he was very close with his parents and loved to go on family trips, his mother said. ""My child would also help with household chores,"" she said.Park would spend time with his father, particularly attending baseball games.While his soccer shoes still await him at Paengmok Port in Jindo, only his bag with his school uniforms was recovered.Kwon Jae-geun (50) and his son, Hyeok-kyu (7)Kwon's family was on board the Sewol ferry to move to start a new life on Jeju Island. They planned to start an orchard there. However, only his youngest daughter Ji-yeon, who is now 9 years old, lives on.Kwon's Vietnamese wife Han Yoon-ji, 29, was found dead. Kwon and his son, Hyeok-kyu, are still missing. Witnesses said Hyeok-kyu, 7 years old, had given his life vest to Ji-yeon.Lee Young-sook (51)When Lee boarded the Sewol ferry, she had just purchased a new house on Jeju Island where she hoped to live with her son after over a decade of living apart.After her husband died, she struggled to make a living and had to leave her son to live with her in-laws.Now, her 35-year-old son awaits his mother's return.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (91%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (91%); FERRIES (90%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); FAMILY (89%); CHILDREN (78%); STUDENT FINANCIAL AID (77%); PHYSICAL EDUCATION (77%); SCHOOL FIELD TRIPS (72%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (65%); ANNIVERSARIES (60%)LOAD-DATE: April 16, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"237","[Noah Feldman] Unbearable slowness of war crimes justice",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","[Noah Feldman] Unbearable slowness of war crimes justice   THE KOREA HERALD December 3, 2017 Sunday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 3, 2017 Sunday[Noah Feldman] Unbearable slowness of war crimes justice LENGTH: 788 wordsThe suicide of Croatian war criminal Slobodan Praljak in open court last week was bizarre. Sure, Hermann Goering famously cheated the executioner at Nuremberg by swallowing cyanide. But Praljak wasn't going to be executed, no matter how many innocent civilians he was found guilty of killing. In the highly civilized, highly bureaucratic world of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the worst thing that can happen is a long jail sentence -- like the 20 years awarded to Praljak.It's precisely the old-timey, anachronistic aspect of the public suicide that carries a lesson. There's a reason the act seemed very 20th century: because it was. The crimes for which Praljak was convicted took place in 1993, when he let his soldiers round up Muslims for slaughter. He was indicted in 2004, and gave himself up for trial then. He was convicted in 2013, 20 years after his crime; his suicide followed the denial of his appeal four years later, in 2017.The lesson is the unbearable slowness of international criminal justice. And it's not only a lesson about Europe. The trials of the Sept. 11 plotters at the US military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are going on now, and it's unlikely any sentence will have been carried out when the 20-year mark comes a few years from now.There are three major problems with such a super-slow judicial process. One is about justice to the particular defendant, who may claim a lack of due process. A speedy trial is a basic constitutional right in the US and in most jurisdictions. The main reason is that no one should be detained for too long without being convicted, but it's also true that the passage of time makes witnesses unreliable and can make it harder for a defendant to mount a credible defense.The difficulty with this criticism as applied to The Hague trials or Guantanamo is that delay can also be the result of a careful process designed to respect all of a defendant's rights. If the defense has made the trial go slowly, the defendant shouldn't be able to use that delay to impugn fairness.The second problem with a slow process involves the cruelty of holding someone for too long before executing a sentence. On the US Supreme Court, the former Justice John Paul Stevens took the view that it becomes unconstitutional to execute someone for a crime when he has been on death row for as long as 17 years.ã€€In the case of the Yugoslavia tribunal, the cruelty wouldn't stem from keeping the defendants on death row, because, like Europe and most of the rest of the world, the tribunal doesn't administer the death penalty. It could conceivably be argued that spending a long time awaiting the resolution of one's case has some elements of cruelty. Once again, however, it would be hard to make this claim if the delay was attributable to a careful process of trial and appeal.ã€€That leaves the most important problem with a slow judicial process: the extended gap between the crimes and the ultimate punishment. This may not be a problem as a matter of pure justice, because terrible wrongs deserve to be addressed even after much time has passed. But it is a significant problem when it comes to the pragmatics and the symbolism of punishing terrible wrongs like those that took place in Yugoslavia.ã€€Practically, the deterrent effect of the eventual punishment is bound to be substantially reduced when it takes so long to bring the perpetrators to justice. A potential genocidal actor might conceivably think twice based on the imminent threat of punishment. But if that punishment is many decades in the future, that actor, like the rest of us humans, will be inclined to discount the future probability of punishment.ã€€ã€€Symbolically, the problem with long-delayed justice lies in the slow, grinding nature of the war crimes tribunals when compared with the short, sharp shock of most war crimes. When a trial takes so long, the problem isn't so much that the evil of the underlying crime becomes banal as that the judicial process takes on its own bureaucratic banality. The process essentially ensures that no one, least of all the defendants or the survivors, can relate the trial to the actual events that gave rise to it.ã€€Praljak's suicide stands out because it seems so serious, so extreme and so urgent. That's in stark contrast to the dullness of the tribunal's justice, slowly moving along a conveyor belt outside of public attention. Soon enough, however, we'll forget about Praljak, the way we forget about all trials that take so long.

'The decision reflected Moon's strong will to prevent the spirit of the movement from being damaged further.'The song, which was popular among student activists in the 1980s, had been sung by all participants at the memorial service until 2008. Then, the conservative Lee Myung-bak administration had the song performed only by a choir since 2011.Far-right figures have claimed the song was sung by North Korean sympathizers, while liberals argued the song has been a symbol of the nation's pro-democracy movement.Despite strong criticisms from the liberal lawmakers as well as relatives of those killed by soldiers during the movement, the Park government maintained the Lee administration's decision to have the song sung only by a choir.Meanwhile, Moon also ordered his aides to speed up the establishment of an advisory committee tasked with setting up direction and aims of the government's policies.'Such a committee is necessary as the new government was launched without a preparatory period with a presidential transition committee,' Moon was quoted as saying.The presidential office added it will establish on- and offline communication channels within the committee so every citizen can suggest various policy ideas.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (94%); HISTORY (91%); DEMOCRACIES (90%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (90%); CONSERVATISM (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); LIBERALISM (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (79%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (78%); PUBLISHING (78%); COUPS (78%); DICTATORSHIPS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); PLATFORMS & ISSUES (77%); HIGH SCHOOLS (77%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (77%); STUDENT ACTIVISM (72%); DISMISSALS (71%); PRESS CONFERENCES (70%); MILITARY RULE (65%); ARMED FORCES (65%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%); MOON JAE-IN (92%); LEE MYUNG-BAK (59%)CITY: KWANGJU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

This is the first such piece under the partnership. - ED.George Washington University inaugurated a program that will expand Korean language and cultural studies at its new Institute for Korean Studies, Thursday, part of an expanded program funded by the South Korean government, officials said.The university established the institute after receiving a grant from the Academy for Korean Studies, a division of the South Korean Ministry of Education.The grant expands the university's existing Korean language minor into an academic major and will host a lecture series. The grant will also help the university establish a newly endowed professorship.GW officials said the Korean studies institute is one of few such programs in the country, and the first in the Washington, D.C., area.Ahn Ho-young, South Korea's ambassador to the United States, said the grant was intended to promote cultural understanding.'Maybe we can have stronger relations on (a) global partnership on the basis of a stronger partnership in the humanities,' Ahn said at the inaugural event.Douglas B. Shaw, the university's senior associate provost for international strategy, said that cultural understanding would enhance economic and diplomatic relations.'Future American leaders will need Korean friends,' Shaw said.University officials said the institute is a good fit because of the school's historical connection to Korea. Steven Knapp, the president of George Washington, said that South Korea is the largest source of international students at the university and that the country maintains the largest alumni group outside the United States.Korean Wave in USThe Korean language has been taught at GW for more than three decades, and the program has steadily grown over that time, officials said. Kim Seong-kon, president of the Korean Literature Translation Institute, said American students are expressing increased interest in Korean culture.'Thirty-eight years ago, when I was studying in the United States, I saw American students put up posters of The Beatles and Che Guevara,' said Kim Seong-kon. 'Today I notice that they put up posters of Psy and Girls' Generation,' popular South Korean K-pop artists.Jisoo Kim, the newly named director of the Korea institute, said the university competed with several academic institutions in the United States and internationally to win the grant.'We were very fortunate that we were able to get it this time,' Kim said. The school and the South Korean government did not specify the amount of the five-year grant.Kim said she hopes the institute will reach beyond academia. The Washington, D.C., area is home to roughly 100,000 Korean-Americans.'Our aim is not just to develop scholarship of Korean studies and curriculum for our students, but also to reach out to the community, especially professionals and policymakers,' Kim said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (90%); JOURNALISM (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (89%); GRANTS & GIFTS (89%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); US PRESIDENTS (78%); FOREIGN STUDENTS (78%); ENDOWMENTS (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (74%); ETHNIC & CULTURAL STUDIES (73%); ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS (73%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (72%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (72%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (71%); ALUMNI (70%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (67%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (67%)ORGANIZATION: GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY (91%); NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY (84%)STATE: DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (94%); ILLINOIS, USA (92%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (99%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (97%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: January 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

She tried to interfere with personnel affairs at public and private institutions and big companies through her friend Choi,' the prosecution said.Park is highly likely to remain uncooperative once she is released from custody, based on her past behavior, it added.'Park refused to appear for questioning multiple times after promising to do so. There was even an incident where she barely made it for the hearing only after being chastised by the court. We cannot expect her cooperation, which would pose a major threat to the court's efforts towards a speedy trial.'Given she gave direct orders and regularly briefed witnesses on the developments, she will definitely try to influence witnesses to change or recant their testimonies, prosecutors said.In response, Yoo Young-ha, the defense attorney for Park, said the prosecution's request was baseless because she has already been questioned over charges concerning the two business groups.'Under criminal law, issuing an arrest warrant is not required if the prosecution is seeking a new one based on charges already specified in the initial indictment documents. Park was questioned and the court has reviewed the testimonies of related figures in full,' Yoo said.He asked the court to show leniency to his client who he described as 'one thrown into the lion's den surrounded by a frantic crowd.''She was elected president after overcoming personal tragedy and has never been involved in any bribery or political scandal. She lost her reputation. This is a trial conducted amid continued public fanaticism. I ask the court to exercise a sense of humanity,' he said.Finding her guilty or not guilty, he said, should be based only on the evidence, not public sentiment.Earlier, the prosecution asked the court to show no leniency to Park, citing the issuance of new arrest warrants for her alleged accomplices after the initial ones expired.They included former presidential secretaries An Chong-bum and Jeong Ho-seong, former Vice Culture Minister Kim Jong and former Korea Creative Content Agency CEO Song Sung-gak.However, Yoo said the arrest warrants for them were all issued because the prosecution added new charges, stressing no such additional charges have been filed against Park.When the court gave Park a chance to speak, she refused.Meanwhile, former member of Saenuri Party Rep. Cho Won-jin, the leader of the far-right minor opposition Korean Patriots' Party, said he would initiate a hunger strike in an effort to have the request dismissed.'The prosecution's move to seek a new arrest warrant is beyond a human rights violation amounting to political confinement. I hereby declare my intention to continue my action in hopes that former President Park stand trial without physical detention and ultimately be released from custody.'Reps. Chung Woo-taek and Kim Jin-tae of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party said they would convene a general party meeting to determine the party's official stance.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (92%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (92%); ARRESTS (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); SUITS & CLAIMS (90%); ARREST WARRANTS (90%); LITIGATION (90%); APPEALS (90%); BRIBERY (90%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (89%); SCANDALS (89%); WITNESSES (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); INDICTMENTS (78%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (78%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CORRUPTION (78%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (78%); WITNESS TAMPERING (78%); PUBLIC PROSECUTORS (78%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (78%); LAWYERS (75%); POLITICS (73%); CRIMINAL LAW (73%); DISMISSALS (71%)COMPANY: SK HOLDINGS CO LTD (57%)TICKER: 003600 (KSE) (57%)INDUSTRY: NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES (57%); SIC2911 PETROLEUM REFINERIES (57%); SIC2676 SANITARY PAPER PRODUCTS (57%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%)LOAD-DATE: October 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

More than 200 billion won ($172 million) was misused in the process.Lead counsel Park Young-soo and his team held a press briefing wrapping up the 90-day investigation and released a 100-page report.Seven former and incumbent Cheong Wa Dae officials were indicted for abuse of authority and coercion including former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two former culture ministers, Cho Yoon-sun and Kim Jong-deok.The remaining four are former Vice Culture Minister Chung Kwan-joo and three presidential secretaries for political affairs (Shin Dong-chul), education and cultural affairs (Kim Sang-yule) and cultural and sports affairs (Kim So-young).The team said the seven indicted figures conspired with President Park and her confidant Choi Soon-sil, the central figure in the influence-peddling scandal, to create and manage the blacklist as a means of gaining the upper hand in cultural content creation and distribution.The blacklist, the team said, was drafted by the Cheong Wa Dae political affairs division and reviewed by the education and culture secretary before being handed to the culture ministry. More than 9,000 liberal artists were blacklisted, which would limit their likelihood of receiving state support.The culture ministry 'controlled' the artists through the Arts Council Korea (ARKO), Korean Film Council (KOFIC) and the Korea Publishing Publication Industry Promotion Agency (KPIPA), the three key art organizations to which artists file applications seeking state support for their projects.The team said the indicted figures removed 19 ARKO committee members in charge of granting subsidies without specifying a reason and had 325 art projects subsequently canceled.They also had KOFIC cancel screenings of eight low-budget movies in state-controlled theaters and had KPIPA withdraw support for publishers of 22 books.One such publisher is Munhakdongne, which published a book titled 'The Country of the Blind,' co-written by 12 writers criticizing the government, in October 2014, six months after the sinking of the Sewol ferry.One billion won in subsidies granted to publishers such as Munhakdongne to support the liberal arts and literature were canceled.The whitelist, the team said, was created by one of the presidential secretary offices to support 75 organizations between 2014 and 2016.Cheong Wa Dae asked the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the key business lobby involved in the scandal, to give 6.8 billion won to the President Park-designated organizations, the names of which remain undisclosed. The pertinent investigation material was handed over to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.The team said charges against Choi include peddling influence in personnel management at financial and public institutions to gain personal benefit.Choi helped Lee Sang-hwa, a branch manager of KEB Hana Bank in Germany, become global marketing manager in return for helping her and her daughter get a loan at a lower-than-market-interest rate in Germany.The team said Choi, through a scrapped state business called Myanmar K-Town worth 76 billion won ($65 million), helped Yoo Jae-kyung, a former executive of Samsung Electro-Mechanics, become ambassador to the country in return for acquiring shares from a company that was scheduled to undertake state business there.Choi, the team added, also exercised influence to name Kim In-shik, 68, former chief of the Korea International Exhibition Center, as chairman of the Korea International Cooperation Agency, a development aid organization under the foreign ministry, which initially led the state project in Myanmar.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); CONSERVATISM (90%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); INDICTMENTS (89%); LIBERALISM (89%); PUBLISHING (85%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (77%); FILM (76%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); SCANDALS (74%); INVESTIGATIONS (74%); CONSPIRACY (74%); LOBBYING (72%); LITERATURE (67%); WRITERS (67%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (67%); CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS (61%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (56%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS (50%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)LOAD-DATE: March 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Meanwhile, only 30 percent of respondents said the fact Korean soldiers had participated in the Vietnam War was a negative factor in their image of Korea.Rather, more people thought Vietnamese brides suffering abuse after moving to Korea and Korean businesses treating Vietnamese workers poorly were bigger factors in creating a negative image. Negative impressions of Korea among Vietnamese people appear to have accumulated more after the two nations established diplomatic relations. Nguyen Thi Thanh Huyen, an associate professor at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities of Vietnam National University, Hanoi, who advised on the survey, said the results in general have affirmed the perceptions of Vietnamese people about Korea.'Vietnamese people have high expectations for the relations between the two countries for further development of the economy and culture of Vietnam,' she said. The professor noted, however, issues related to Vietnamese marriage migrants and poor treatment of Vietnamese workers have negatively affected Korea's reputation. 'In the future, if those issues are repaired, the image of Korea would be much more positive and relations between the two countries would have stronger attachments, and be friendly and attaching to the core values of each country in all aspects,' she said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (89%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (78%); VIETNAM WAR (78%); MARRIAGE (78%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (78%); ANNIVERSARIES (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (70%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (66%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (66%); 2018 PYEONGCHANG WINTER OLYMPICS (64%); OLYMPICS (64%); WINTER OLYMPICS (50%); PARALYMPICS (50%)CITY: HANOI, VIETNAM (78%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); VIET NAM (93%); VIETNAM (78%)LOAD-DATE: December 21, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"246","How scholarship can reduce African unemployment",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"September","How scholarship can reduce African unemployment  Korea Times September 5, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesSeptember 5, 2017 TuesdayHow scholarship can reduce African unemploymentBYLINE: By Seife Ayele, Samir Khan, and Jim SumbergLENGTH: 843 wordsBRIGHTON - With two thirds of Africa's population under 25 years of age, the continent's youth may be its biggest competitive advantage. After all, countries' long-term economic prospects are typically linked to the availability of a young, mobile labor force. A recent report by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation concluded that ten of the world's 25 fastest-growing economies between 2004 and 2014 were in Africa. And yet, with many millions of young people unemployed in 2015, and many more underemployed, Africa has so far failed to reach its full potential.The continent's youth-employment challenge persists for many reasons. For starters, youth-focused policies and interventions are limited across the region. Programs that do exist lack adequate coordination, and often fail to incorporate lessons and feedback. Employment strategies have also tended to be largely theory-based; while well meaning, they can fail to deliver results when put into practice.But in our view, an additional, often overlooked weakness is an academic environment that limits contributions from Africa's youngest scholars - students just finishing their PhDs - who may in fact hold the keys to putting the continent to work. Experience shows that young African doctoral students produce research that is crucial to addressing the continent's development challenges. And yet, far too often, these young minds lack the training, access, and support they need to bring their ideas from the field to the policymaking arena.That is why we have joined a global initiative to provide young African researchers an opportunity to engage in policy-oriented solutions, through research collaboration and publishing opportunities. Launched in 2016 by The MasterCard Foundation and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in the United Kingdom, the Matasa Fellows Network aims to bring together the continent's young academic talent to help solve Africa's youth employment challenge.Because that challenge is closely connected to other issues - like migration, conflict, rural development, and gender - policymakers must cast a wide net when considering solutions. Our fellows' research on these issues poses vital questions to governments and development funders about how to design solutions and implement them in ways that ensure accountability.The first cohort of fellows, who recently published their findings in the IDS Bulletin, included ten African doctoral students working in the social sciences. With coaching and mentorship from IDS staff, the fellows fine-tuned their ideas through peer mentorship and worked to generate policy ideas through interactions with government officials and NGOs professionals.The fellows' output so far has been remarkable: policy briefs on a diverse range of topics, including youth unemployment in Ghana, livestock production in Kenya, and regional strategies for improving youth-led entrepreneurship. The inaugural Matasa fellows also studied the political dimensions of youth employment and policy processes in Ethiopia; the social and cultural concerns underpinning employment choices across the continent; how mentorship affects entrepreneurship; and how young Africans view illicit industries, like gambling and sex work.Some of the fellows' research has generated remarkable results - all the more so for being counterintuitive. For example, Kampala-based researcher Nicholas Kilimani's survey of employment strategies found that, contrary to commonly held assumptions, youth unemployment rates actually rise proportional to educational attainment. Solving the employment crisis will therefore require creative thinking, Kilimani argues. 'The youth employment challenge requires policy action beyond basic education and labor markets,' he writes, 'into areas such as credit markets, infrastructure, business regulation, and rural development.'The work of Maurice Sikenyi, who studied Kenya's Youth Enterprise Development Fund, a government-run microfinancing initiative, is equally innovative. Using primary interviews and secondary data, the University of Minnesota scholar concluded that the fund's reach and impact was being weakened by corruption, vague eligibility criteria, long wait times for loan processing, and an underappreciation of the risks young people take when starting their own business. His paper explores how the development program could be strengthened through greater attention to accountability measures and a renewed focus on mentorship.Africa can turn the corner on youth employment. To do so, however, African decision-makers need to engage more deeply with the continent's youngest, brightest researchers - who often are uniquely positioned to lend key insights - and build new nodes of academic connectivity between the continent's research, policy, and practice.Seife Ayele and Jim Sumberg are research fellows at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex.

"248","Diplomacy dead between Seoul, Tokyo",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Diplomacy dead between Seoul, Tokyo  Korea Times January 19, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesJanuary 19, 2017 ThursdayDiplomacy dead between Seoul, TokyoBYLINE: By Yi Whan-wooLENGTH: 629 wordsBoth Korea and Japan are finding it increasingly difficult to seek a diplomatic solution to the dispute over 'comfort woman' statues amid negative public sentiment toward each other.This is partly because politicians and bureaucrats in the countries are taking advantage of the incendiary issue for their own political interests.Since the dispute was triggered by the placement of a statue outside the Japanese consulate in Busan, Dec. 30, politicians have been taking more hawkish stances on historical issues between the two countries, analysts said.'I'm concerned about the politicians linking their domestic situations with diplomacy,' Cho Yang-hyun, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, said Thursday.'The diplomatic conflict surrounding historical issues will be inevitable if Korea and Japan continue to be hawkish over the matter. Moreover, such unfavorable circumstances will leave a burden for the next Korean government in its ties with Japan.'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been falling short of taking countermeasures after Tokyo took retaliatory action Jan. 6 over the presence of the statue of a young girl symbolizing comfort women in Busan.The foreign ministry's bungled efforts came amid a leadership vacuum caused by the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.Despite this, potential candidates for a possible early presidential election this year have been stepping up criticism of Japan and its agreement with Korea reached in December 2015 over sex slavery during the 1910-45 Japanese occupation of Korea.Tokyo cited the agreement in its retaliation against Seoul, saying the statue in Busan was in violation of the 'final and irrevocable' deal to settle disputes over comfort women.Opposition presidential hopefuls Moon Jae-in, Lee Jae-myung, Ahn Cheol-soo and Park Won-soon promised to nullify, review, scrap or renegotiate the sex slavery deal.Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is highly likely to run for the presidency, also said Korea should return the 1 billion yen already sent by Japan if such an offer was made under the condition that any statue in front of Japanese diplomatic missions should be removed.To further complicate things, Gyeonggi Province Council pledged this week to set up a new comfort woman statue on Korea's easternmost islets of Dokdo.If erected, it will join 55 other comfort woman statues that have been installed nationwide by civic activists.The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea's Rep. Park Kwang-on proposed a bill Thursday asking the government to help maintain the statues.Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University, said, 'The presidential hopefuls are highlighting the diplomatic issue with Japan to ensure they separate themselves from the unpopular Park Geun-hye government.'He speculated Japan's retaliation against Korea was made as part of efforts to divert public attention following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's failure in two key diplomatic policies.Abe has still not convinced incoming U.S. President Donald Trump not to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which Abe said will be 'meaningless without the U.S.'Abe also ended his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dec. 15, in a stalemate over disputed islands lying between the two countries.Shin pointed out that Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida may have also provoked Seoul, Wednesday, by claiming Dokdo was Japanese territory to divert public attention from Abe's diplomatic mishaps.Kishida's remark was made in response to the Gyeonggi council's pledge to install a comfort woman statue on the islets.Meanwhile, the foreign ministry here said, Thursday, that it was not appropriate to link issues concerning Dokdo with the comfort women statues.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (90%); POLITICS (90%); PEACE PROCESS (90%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (89%); AGREEMENTS (89%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (87%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (78%); SETTLEMENT & COMPROMISE (78%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (78%); ELECTIONS (77%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (77%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (72%); SLAVERY (71%); UNITED NATIONS (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (69%); IMPEACHMENT (66%); COMMUNITY ACTIVISM (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%); SHINZO ABE (79%); MOON JAE-IN (79%); BAN KI-MOON (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); TOKYO, JAPAN (90%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (98%); NORTHERN ASIA (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)LOAD-DATE: January 19, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"249","[Kim Seong-kon] A turbulent train named Korea",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"November","[Kim Seong-kon] A turbulent train named Korea   THE KOREA HERALD November 20, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDNovember 20, 2017 Monday[Kim Seong-kon] A turbulent train named Korea LENGTH: 882 wordsRecently, I watched the Korean film 'Train to Busan' with great enthusiasm. Initially I thought the movie must be one of those low-budget horror movies, or a cheap imitation of Hollywood zombie movies at best. I know the genre quite well. Therefore, nothing is new or fresh to me when it comes to zombie movies. To my surprise, however, I found 'Train to Busanï'refreshing and mesmerizing. Of course, the format was familiar and there had already been a foreign movie about a runaway train full of zombies. Nevertheless, there was much more to the recent Korean zombie thriller. For one, there were few graphic scenes. Even though zombies were attacking and swarming over victims, they were not the main concern of the movie. 'Train to Busanï'was a thought-provoking film that made viewers brood on their present predicament.In the movie, South Korea is infected by a deadly virus that turns those infected into zombies. A group of survivors succeed in boarding a KTX train bound for Busan, but the train, too, is soon overrun with zombies. In their isolated compartment, they watch the minister of interior announce in a press conference that it is only a clash between violent demonstrators and the riot police, which is under control now. Once again, neither the government not the press is trustworthy in times of crisis. At Daejeon station, the survivors get off the train as instructed, but they are attacked by soldiers who have turned into zombies. It is symbolic and scary that even soldiers, who are supposed to protect the people, turn against them. While the train seems to be a fine metaphor for Korea, the compartments serve as a microcosm of our society. Inside the safe compartment, even the survivors turn against one another, selfishly banishing the latecomers from the compartment and shutting the door to prevent other survivors from entering. Men easily lose their humanity in times of crisis and are overcome by their bestiality. Humans with bigotry, prejudice and selfishness are scarier than zombies. Brave men like Seok-woo and Sang-hwa try to overcome ordeals and sacrifice themselves for others if necessary. But there are selfish cowards like Yon-suk and the conductor as well. When the train finally arrives in Busan, the only safe haven in the country, only a child and a pregnant woman are rescued. They are a symbol of our future.'Train to Busanï'reminded me of 'Snowpiercer,'an English-language Korean-Czech film based on a French graphic novel, which was also illuminating. In the latter, the train also serves as a microcosm of our society, where the underprivileged in the tail compartment want to revolt against the privileged people in the head compartment near the engine room. 'Snowpiercerï'well illustrates the fact that even though there is a revolt, another dictator is likely to replace the former dictator unless you boldly break out of the system. Indeed, Curtis Everett, who initially led the revolt, ends up becoming another tyrant. Even Curtisï'mentor Gilliam turns out to be a secret friend of Minister Wilford, the mastermind of the train. They just use and manipulate people to gain political power and people are easily deceived by them. Both the leaders on the opposite sides warn the passengers against breaking out of the system because their power depends on the people being locked in the system. Only Minsu jumps off the train, breaking free from the system.'Snowpiercerï'reminded me of Yi Mun-yol's famous short story 'Pilon's Pig.ï'It is a story of a man who has just completed his mandatory military duty in the Korean Army and has boarded a military train to return home. His compartment is designated for discharged soldiers. Suddenly, a group of wild soldiers, presumably the Marines, breaks into the compartment loudly and begins collecting money by force, threatening and beating up discharged soldiers. The tyrannical Marines could be a metaphor for ruthless military dictators, whereas the meek discharged soldiers are a symbol of the repressed people of Korea. Suddenly, a demagogue hiding in the crowd instigates the discharged soldiers to fight back and pay back. Then an angry crowd lynches the Marines in blind anger. Using the military train as a metaphor for our society, Yi brilliantly renders the social milieu of our society during the military dictatorship. He tackles the complex issues of our society: tyranny, injustice, and violence. Yi criticizes the dictatorial Marines to be sure. At the same time, however, Yi also indicts demagogues hiding in the crowd and the brutality of people infuriated by blind hatred under the banner of greater good and justice. Yi poses a question: 'Can violence for justice be justified?ï'He says no, as any great writer would do.We are like passengers in a train infested by zombies, divided into antagonizing groups and plagued by violence and vengeance. We hope it is not a runaway train to be derailed soon. We want to arrive at our final destination safe and sound.By Kim Seong-konKim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and president of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea.

Literature in university language programs   THE KOREA HERALD October 23, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 23, 2017 Monday[Letter to editor] Whereâ€™s our humanities? Literature in university language programs LENGTH: 399 wordsIn the 21st century the place of literature in university language programs is a dubious one. Its usefulness is questioned, even among the well-educated, and even among language professors themselves. For in the digital age the prevalent notion seems to be: If it's not quantifiable, it's not worth a damn.ã€€I disagree with this current assumption. All knowledge is not reducible to mathematical data, or the scrutiny of scientific inquiry, or its direct value to the corporate/technological/political bottom line. For first and foremost, literature teaches students about what it's like to be human. It articulates the life experiences of those who are like ourselves as well as those who are different than us. It instructs us about 'the otherï'-- other people, other places, other times, other life experiences.ã€€Our times are complicated, and people are complicated as well. We laugh, we cry, we sing, we shout, we love, we hate, and in the end we die. All of us. We are in part a sentient species and literature can teach us something about human sentiments -- the complexities of romantic love, for example -- even before we experience such a complicated emotion ourselves. Think Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Literature can let us know about death and people's reaction to it, as in Tolstoy's story about Ivan Illyich. Or a story which deals with both love and death, Irish writer James Joyce's 'The Deadï'in which one Gabriel Conroy's wife Gretta weeps openly after a party the couple attended, and admits to her husband it was a song she heard at the party, the same song her first love who died at seventeen sang to her near the time of his death, that brought her tears. She falls asleep and Gabriel, at the end of the story, watches the snow at the window and contemplates the nature of 'true love,ï'and his, as well as all humanity's, mortality.Human relations are only one of the reasons literature should be included in 'language majors,ï'I repeat 'language majors,ï'programs. After all, aren't human relations at the roots of the world's major problems today?If it's not quantifiable, it's not worth a damn?As my Irish ancestors would say, 'Tain't so, McGee.'Kenneth ParsonsAssistant ProfessorGeneral English Education ProgramSeoKyeong UniversityLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); LETTERS & COMMENTS (90%); WRITERS (73%); DEATH & DYING (72%)LOAD-DATE: October 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Conservatives said change is needed to correct the ""left-leaning tilt"" of existing books that tend to be lenient towards North Korea.After intense public debate, the new textbook was written with fuller descriptions of Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula, including its sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II. It also acknowledged that the Saemaeul Movement was a ""state-led"" reform project to overcome poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War.One of the disputes centered on the description of the date Aug. 15, 1948. While the government has designated it as the foundation day of the Republic of Korea, historians argued it should be known as the foundation day of the government of the Republic of Korea as the country already existed in the form of a government-in-exile.In announcing guidelines for state-authorized textbooks, the ministry said it will allow both expressions to be used.The new textbook will go into use next year along with several state-authorized textbooks that are currently in the making. Schools will be given the freedom to choose among the different versions.

The park will open to the public on Sept. 1. / YonhapSeoulâ€™s urban renewal project to vitalize cultural gatheringsWest of Seoul World Cup Stadium in Mapo-gu, a new park for various cultural activities will open to the public Sept. 1. Inside the park are oil tanks and a platform that have been renovated into six distinct spaces for performances, art displays and other gatherings.The renovation of the 140,022-square-meter space is an initiative taken by the Seoul city government as part of its ongoing urban renewal projects. It follows the recent reopening of the overpass-turned-park Seoullo 7017 that connects the area around Seoul Station using an old overpass.Just like Seoullo, the new cultural complex was born using existing structures: tanks that once held 69 million liters of including gasoline and diesel. They were constructed in 1976 in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, and the area has since been closed to the public for security reasons. In November 2000, it was classified as a hazardous facility and permanently shut down. Its opening therefore marks the landâ€™s return to the citizens, who have been denied access for the past four decades.The renovated five tanks still bear some of their organic features. One tank, partway up the slope of Mt. Maebong, is preserved in its original shape and form and is the only space visitors are denied inside access.Each tank has a unique vibe, offering a distinct sense of how the space could be used. One tank has been reformed into an oval-shaped space enclosed by glass walls surrounded by trees. One tank is completely dark, with videos and images projected on its round walls. Another is an open space with a stage spanning across the tank wall and chairs scattered on its opposite side.The first event at the complex takes place this weekend, from Friday to Saturday, allowing visitors a preview before its official opening. An arts market festival will present street art and concerts, opening up space for artists and visitors.Various affairs are planned until the end of the year. Programs include music festivals, circuses and art workshops. A tour around the complex will be offered from its opening until the end of October. A gallery presenting a historical timeline of the space, from its life as oil tanks to a cultural complex, is also available until then.The project is called â€œMunhwa Bichuk Gijiâ€ which translates to â€œCulture Reserve Base.â€A view of the entire park. / Courtesy of Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FESTIVALS (89%); URBAN DEVELOPMENT (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (79%); CLOSINGS (78%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (78%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (78%); CITIES (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); STREET ART (77%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (76%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (75%); CHRONOLOGIES (73%); OIL & GAS SHORTAGES (73%); DIESEL FUEL (73%); GASOLINE (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (70%); HISTORY (69%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (69%); MUSIC (60%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)LOAD-DATE: August 27, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

A handful of big shopping malls have noticed the potential for such demand and are taking steps to catch up. One case in point is Starfield shopping mall, which recently opened in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, just west of Seoul. The mega shopping center comes with a variety of children-friendly stores to allow families to spend a day together.While shopping at Starfield Goyang, parents of young children can rest at Marie's Baby Circle, one of the largest specialty stores tailored for infants and toddlers at the mall. 'The store's customers are usually parents with toddlers,ï'store manager Yoo Kyung-moo said. 'They come to the shop and use convenience facilities before and after purchasing products.ï'The store is fully equipped with a diaper-changing room, breast-feeding room and separate restroom. Each room is designed for the whole family. 'Since it is a store designated for infants and toddlers, it is much easier to go around with a baby stroller,ï'said a mother surnamed Hong, there with her 13-month-old. Many also visit the store for classes at the Baby Culture Studio, where toddlers can take music and art classes, or just build with toy blocks, all under the guise of professional instructors. The classes allow tired parents to shop safe in the knowledge their children are being well taken care of.Inside the store, a crowds form at Marie's Baby Food Cafe. According to the manager, many customers are drawn to the cafe. Parents can even order baby food there, as the cafe offers seven different meals depending on the child's developmental stage. 'I left the house today with a much smaller bag than usual. I just stopped by the cafe to feed the baby,ï'Hwang Do-hye, a mother of two, said. 'It is not as reliable as the meal I make at home, but it is a convenient substitution.ï'Starfield Goyang has been built in consideration of its core customers -- parents coming with children -- and for that, toys are essential.Toy Kingdom is a massive store with more than 8,500 kinds of toys. It differentiates itself from other shops with well-furnished experience zones. Children get to do more than just test the toys out. They can play with them. Kids can build a block kingdom on a specially designed table or test their shooting skills with toy guns, aiming at an electronically reflective screen. They can also steer radio-controlled cars on a race track. 'Kids can play with extraordinary toys here, which are too big or too expensive for home,ï'supervisor Kang Byung-ki said. 'But what makes it more amazing is that it is a store not just for the children, but also the parents.ï'While children play with new toys, parents can also have fun browsing figurines and model trains. But if these experience zones are not enough, families can also visit Toy Kingdom Play, a full-fledged experience facility. Children can try working in simulated real-life jobs at a work-experience theme park. They can also create works of art with crayon helmets or enjoy imaginary worlds created with light.What makes the theme park appealing for parents is that they can take their eyes away from the children for a while, as the park's professional instructors look after the children. 'I am not looking for a babysitter here. As I work on weekdays, I want to be with my child when I have a chance,ï'a mother of a 4-year-old daughter with the surname of Lee said. 'When we visit this place, I can play with my daughter but I don't have to pay full-time attention to her. She has fun, I have fun too.

The committee is tasked with overseeing the design and management of a public discussion on the fate of the two reactors, which are 29 percent complete.The committee will select a group of 'citizen jurors,' conduct surveys and hold public hearings over the next three months. The 'jurors' will make a decision on the construction of the reactors by Oct. 21.Kim Ji-hyung, who served as a Supreme Court justice under the President Roh Moo-hyun administration, will head the panel. The eight other committee members are experts from four fields: humanities and society, science and technology, surveys and statistics, and conflict management.To ensure neutrality, the government excluded energy and nuclear experts. The committee members are considered to be moderates. But given that Kim is progressive-minded, pro-nuclear experts accused the government of having broken its promise to form a neutral panel.In a briefing Monday, Minister of Government Policy Coordination Hong Nam-ki said, 'The committee will maintain fairness, independence and transparency without outside interference. The government will accept the jury's final conclusion.' But considering that President Moon is ramping up his resolve to wean Korea off nuclear energy, there are suspicions that the conclusion _ permanently halting the construction _ may have already been made.True, the success of the public debate will depend on whether fair procedures are observed. Canvassing opinion in a transparent and fair manner is the only way to minimize the aftermath of the decision. Not surprisingly, the emergence of even slight suspicions would result in confusion and a schism in public opinion.To prevent controversy over bias, the committee should disclose all procedures clearly. This principle must be strictly applied to the selection of 'citizen jurors,' with their regional backgrounds and generations carefully considered.Needless to say, the citizens need to fully take into account the government's electricity demand-supply plan, energy security and national competitiveness as well as the danger of nuclear power plants before making their decision.It also might be necessary to extend the 90-day duration of the committee. Of course, there is no need to delay the decision too long, but phasing out nuclear power is too important an issue to be determined hastily. Jurors must have enough time to review all details related to our precarious energy conditions.Whether resolving social conflict through public discussion is viable is still debatable, considering accusations against the government's buck-passing. Nonetheless, we hope that the jury's forthcoming decision about the nuclear reactors will set a good precedent in settling disputes in our society.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); JURY TRIALS (90%); CONSTRUCTION DELAYS & STOPPAGES (89%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (78%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (78%); JUDGES (76%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (74%); SUPREME COURTS (73%); POWER PLANTS (72%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (72%); ENERGY DEMAND (72%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (69%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (68%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%)LOAD-DATE: July 26, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A'Wu said Beijing would work hard to bring the US and North Korea to the negotiating table for direct talks, according to South Korea's Justice Party's presidential candidate Sim Sang-jung.'Since the US is rejecting the idea of holding multilateral negotiations, [we] will actively work to arrange talks between the US and North Korea,' Sim quoted Wu as saying during the meeting, reported the Yonhap News Agency.On Monday, South Korea's chief nuclear envoy Kim Hong-kyun said after meeting Wu that Beijing and Seoul agreed to impose additional and tougher sanctions on North Korea if it carried out nuclear or long-range missile tests. In February, China announced it was halting all coal imports from the North for the rest of the year following a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution targeting the exports of the reclusive state. China recently denied entry of a fleet of cargo ships from the North after having ordered its trading companies to return coal back home, Reuters reported.But the US has repeatedly called for China to do more to rein in North Korea's nuclear programme. Chinese experts said Beijing was likely to consider tougher actions if Pyongyang continued to defy calls for denuclearisation.Lu Chao, director of the Border Studies Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said banning oil imports from North Korea and cutting off its sources of foreign currency could be among options considered. Lu said China needed to try harder to bring the US and North Korea together for direct talks, but current lukewarm ties between Beijing and Pyongyang was an obstacle.Trump 'reaffirmed the strength of the United States?Republic of Korea alliance and agreed to stay in close touch regarding North Korea and other issues of mutual concern,' according to a statement released by the White House on Saturday, a day after Xi Jinping left the US. Trump and Xi held a two-day summit at the US leader's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.A separate White House announcement on Sunday said: 'President Trump and Prime Minister Abe also agreed to further cooperation on a range of regional issues, including the threat posed by North Korea.'The US was building a 'global coalition' to counter threats from Pyongyang, Susan Thornton, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters in Washington a day before the Florida summit.'Patience has basically come to an end.

But I can analyze a poem in four languages.'Following the controversy over her comment, the German government decided to introduce the subject of finance related to real life at 110 high schools starting from last November.Outside lecturersOh Heung-seonIn Korea, schools have been seeking outside help for financial education.Among the experts is Oh Heung-seon, a former director of the Korea Financial Education Association and adjunct professor of the Division of Finance and Accounting at Cyber Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.'I introduce diverse careers in finance or accounting such as fund manager and analyst to middle school students during my class,' Oh said.He provides classes tailored to needs of students at each grade level.For example, he teaches elementary school students how to write a pocket money entry book while advising high school students, who are able to start a part-time job, on how to cope with a situation such as failing to get paid.'I felt that financial education helped students foster personality,' Oh said, citing his experience of delivering a lecture at a juvenile prison in Gimcheon, North Gyeongsang Province.'After taking my class, a 15-year-old boy told me that he wanted to take a school qualification examination and obtain a welding license to make money,'Oh said. 'He came to have a great dream for his life.'BanksBanks are at the forefront of financial education especially for the banking system. Shinhan Bank launched a financial education program in 2012 to help students learn basic knowledge and tips on how to become financially smart.For this, the bank established an education center in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul. 'Schools and individual students can apply for our program which is so popular that applications are closed at the moment,' Shin Yun-jin, deputy general manager of the corporate social responsibility department at the bank, said.Since last year when all middle schools adopted a free learning semester, in which middle school first graders spend one semester without tests to explore future career paths, schools actively seek such programs to provide finance education to students.In Shinhan's program, students are able to play the role of both clients and bankers at the center which has exactly the same setting as a real bank.'It is interesting to open a bank account as a bank client and issue a card as a banker,' said Lee Song-mi, 17, a second grader at Dangjin Information High School in Dangjin, South Chungcheong Province. 'As I have dreamed of entering banking after graduating from high school, this experience will undoubtedly help me in seeking jobs.'For those who cannot come to the bank's center in Seoul, Shinhan also sends bankers to schools to teach students. All branches of Shinhan throughout the nation have relationships with about 580 schools as of last year.In the case of schools located in remote areas, the bank also sends traveling branches called Van Birds which the bank created last year.The van is equipped with a small-scale bank branch setting so that students are able to experience banker and client roles as well.'We focus on making classes interesting so that students can get interested in finance because finance is not so imminent an issue for them,' Shin said. 'We make sure that we do not encourage students to become a banker but we explain what bankers, which we believe is the basics of career education.'Government effortAccording to the guidelines for the national curriculum which was revised in 2015 and will be implemented beginning this year, high school students will learn basic social studies and science in their first year.'Recognizing the importance of financial education, we expanded the finance part in social studies,' Gil Hyun-joo, an educational researcher at the Ministry of Education, said.In an effort to quell rising concerns over a lack of expertise in finance among social studies teachers, the ministry conducted training programs for 2,400 teachers from September through December last year.'We will provide training programs for more than 5,000 teachers this year as well,' Gil said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: BANKING & FINANCE (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); ECONOMICS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (90%); CHILDREN (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (78%); STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS (78%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMS (78%); ACADEMIC TESTING (78%); CURRICULA (78%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (75%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (73%); JUVENILE JUSTICE (71%); MUTUAL FUNDS (70%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS (69%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (64%)COMPANY: SHINHAN FINANCIAL GROUP CO LTD (58%)TICKER: SHG (NYSE) (58%); 055550 (KSE) (58%)INDUSTRY: NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (58%); NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (53%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); ASIA (79%); EASTERN ASIA (78%); GERMANY (69%)LOAD-DATE: January 4, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The exhibition title was inspired by the Korean interjection ""eolssigu,"" which Curti thought similar to Spain's ""ole."" He was fascinated by the similarities of the two countries folk music after attending the workshop.Kim Hee-sun of the National Gugak Center said, ""This exhibit is going to provide a chance for both countries to experience cultural differences and broaden the understanding on traditional music and the performing arts.""For the Barcelona exhibit, the National Gugak Center gathered the finest of Korean traditional instruments including ""gayageum"" (12-string zither), ajaeng (seven-string bowed zither) and haegeum (two-stringed fiddle). The center also donated some 30 ""janggu"" (hourglass-shaped drum) for educational purpose last year.Other than musical instruments, other related objects such as masks used in traditional Korean mask dance will also be on display.The exhibit runs through June 3, 2018.

DeepMind wrote.??The research team behind AlphaGo will now throw their energy into the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,?? it said.Since its debut last year, AlphaGo??s outstanding performance against human Go masters has offered the public a taste of how AI, when applied to certain settings, can surpass human intelligence.During a series of matches held in Seoul last year, the gaming AI program??s victory against Korea??s Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol had proved to the public that AI??s implications are imminent and wide.Google is now slated to continue its efforts to apply the key technology behind AlphaGo -- a form of high-level machine learning called deep learning -- to perform difficult tasks in more critical human sectors.Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming.The US tech giant is already engaged in efforts to apply deep learning to the field of medicine. It has been training machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in an eye or cancerous tumors.So far, researchers at Google??s medical imaging team have made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world, according to the company.The tech giant is also working to apply deep learning to cancer diagnostics, developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.However, it will take some time before devices running on Google??s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval, said Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research.For those wondering what will happen to AlphaGo as it officially retreats from competitive play, Google??s DeepMind said it will publish a final academic paper detailing the algorithm??s efficiency and potential for general use later this year.The company said it will also work with Ke Jie to introduce a teaching tool that shows AlphaGo??s analysis of Go positions, providing insights into how the program thinks and giving the public an opportunity to see the game through the eyes of AlphaGo. It has also introduced a special set of AlphaGo vs. AlphaGo games -- the AI learned to play Go by playing millions of games against itself -- that contain ??many new and interesting ideas and strategies,?? according to DeepMind.

'We agreed to resolve North Korean nuclear issue peacefully, and to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula,' Moon said at a joint press conference at Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office. Saying that he and Trump renewed the resolve to work together on the issue, Moon said that the two countries agreed to strengthen the allied defense posture. Moon said that the two countries will 'cooperate on an unprecedented level' in boosting South Korea's defense capabilities, and to immediately begin talks regarding acquisition and development of new military equipment by South Korea. Moon also revealed that the agreement to lift restrictions on South Korea's ballistic missile payload was finalized. According to Cheong Wa Dae, the two sides adopted new missile guidelines that impose no limits on Korea's missiles during the day's summit talks. A high-level Korean official later revealed that the weapons acquisition and development talks concern nuclear-powered submarines and surveillance assets. 'Nuclear-powered submarines and cutting-edge surveillance assets are included (in the talks). An agreement was reached in principle, but there are many elements that must be reviewed and discussed,ï'the official said on condition of anonymity. Overall, Trump's remarks concerning North Korea echoed those of Moon, and he urged the international community to work together in pressuring the regime. 'North Korea's sixth test of a nuclear device and its missile launches are a threat not only to the people of South Korea but to the people all across our globe,ï'Trump said. 'North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation, including China and Russia, to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs, and live in peace.'Trump, however, warned that the US would bring its military into the equation if necessary. 'As we work together to resolve this problem using all of available tools short of military action, the US stands to prepare to defend itself and allies using full range of unmatched military capabilities if need be,ï'Trump said.In response to a question on whether he viewed the situation to be progressing, Trump said that 'it makes senseï'for North Korea to denuclearize and that such a decision would be 'for humanity all over the world.'He said there is 'certain movement,ï'but declined to elaborate on the possibility of engaging North Korea directly. On the issue of bilateral trade, Trump reiterated his assessment of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement, saying the two sides are looking to improve economic relations. 'I would like to thank President Moon for instructing his trade negotiators to work closely with us to quickly pursue a much better deal -- a deal that, frankly, has been quite unsuccessful and not very good for the United States,ï'Trump said. Although Seoul had maintained that the trade pact was reciprocal in nature, the two sides are now working on modifying the deal. Against much speculation from local pundits, the issue of South Korea's share of US military costs incurred here was not given significant mention. Ahead of Trump's visit, local media and experts had raised the possibility that Trump could use his state visit to raise the concern. Korea's presidential office also appeared wary of the possibility, with officials highlighting the significance of Camp Humphreys, the first stop on Trump's South Korean itinerary, on a number of occasions. Located in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, the installation is the largest overseas base operated by the US. Building the base has incurred costs of about $10 billion, over 90 percent of which has been shouldered by Seoul.

It said the meeting will aim at reviewing and discovering common problems that affect life in five districts - Guro, Geumgcheon, Yeongdeungpo, Dongjak and Gwanak - and finding solutions.'The population of ethnic Korean Chinese in Seoul is concentrated in those five districts and they are generating problems in terms of social adaptation, education and integration with local populations,' the office handling foreign residents said in a statement.Ethnic Korean Chinese began to come to Seoul beginning in 1992 after China and South Korea opened diplomatic relations. They're considered as Koreans by law and receive working permits upon arrival.According to statistics, 222,000 are currently living in Seoul, with 139,000 or 63 percent staying in five districts.Economic opportunity and transportation were the main points to attract them to the area. It had affordable housing and many factories which meant potential jobs for them.However, the immigrant population contributed to a worsening stigma in the area. Many locals see the area as a less safe place, with frequent crime. Social integration between immigrants and natives has been a tall order. When the news of a murder involving a Chinese suspect was reported a few years ago, the native residents of the area were fearful and perceived it as a discriminatory crime.Friday's meeting isn't the first of its kind.Previous meetings generated projects such as a neighborhood patrol, installing safety lights on the streets, providing Korean language classes and vocational training to the immigrant population and supporting community meetings. The city said it's currently working on revitalizing the neighborhood streets in Daerim-dong with an aim to attract tourists to the area as well.'We are confident that the meeting will make these neighborhoods good places so everyone can live together harmoniously,' said a city official.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); CITIES (89%); IMMIGRATION (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (77%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (73%); URBAN DEVELOPMENT (73%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (70%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (70%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (70%); STATISTICS (68%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (55%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (99%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (99%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); CHINA (79%)LOAD-DATE: September 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The court found former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon guilty of abuse of authority and bearing false witness in compiling the list of nearly 10,000 artists across film, music, literature and fine arts. He was sentenced to three years in prison. Former Culture Minister Cho Yoon-sun was found guilty of false testimony, but was acquitted of abusing her authority as minister, receiving a one-year jail sentence with two years of probation. ??The act of discriminating artists by Cheong Wa Dae and the Culture Ministry severely oppressed the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, and cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,?? head Judge Hwang Byung-heon said. The remaining five former ranking presidential and Culture Ministry officials include former Culture Minister Kim Jong-deok -- Cho??s predecessor -- and Senior Secretary for Education and Culture Kim Sang-ryul. They were handed down prison terms ranging from 1 1/2 years with two years of probation to two years for banning state sponsorship of the artists in collusion with the two.The list was used under the Park administration as a basis for excluding left-wing artists, including 2016 Man Booker International Prize winner Han Kang and ??Oldboy?? film director Park Chan-Wook, from state subsidies and projects. On the list were artists who in their works had criticized Park, her late strongman father Park Chung-hee and her political incompetence regarding the botched handling of the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014. More than 300 people, mainly children on a school trip, lost their lives in the disaster. In February, 461 of those on the list took legal action against the Park administration, seeking 1 million won ($900) each for breaches of their right to freedom of expression. The blacklist case is part of a wider political corruption scandal that led to Park being removed from office in March.Park is in detention and standing her own trial following her indictment in April over 18 charges including bribery, extortion and abuse of power.

Tokyo has been disregarding the quite natural wish and demand of the Korean people, including the victims, for a 'genuine apology' over the wartime atrocity. Money does not matter. What we ask is that Japan recognizes frankly what it did as Germany has done.As Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said in her announcement, Japan should accept the truth as it is in observance of universal norms and standards, and continue to help restore the victims' honor and dignity.Tokyo should listen to the voice of an 88-year-old victim living in a shelter for survivors of the brutal crime against humanity asking only for an apology from Japan before she dies and nothing more.The comfort women issue does not go beyond Korea and Japan, though it is an international question. Japan is undisputedly an advanced country, which rose to become an international power from the ashes of war. Now is the time for Japan to admit to the sexual enslavement, thus making it a good lesson to help fight ever-increasing sexual violence against women and to improve women's rights.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: WORLD WAR II (90%); AGREEMENTS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); WOMEN (89%); SLAVERY (89%); SEX OFFENSES (78%); ARMIES (78%); SEXUAL ASSAULT (78%); WAR & CONFLICT (78%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (77%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (77%); ARMED FORCES (77%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (76%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (74%); FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS (73%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (71%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (68%); EMERGENCY SHELTERS (67%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (78%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); TOKYO, JAPAN (88%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (99%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); GERMANY (68%)LOAD-DATE: January 10, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It requires not just business minds for profit but also ceaseless pursuits for technological innovations.As a founder and chief engineer, James Dyson has led his namesake company to global success with leading developments in its unique motor technologies.'I am an engineer at heart,' Dyson said in an interview with The Korea Times. 'It is not a particular category that interests me but the approach to inventing things that matters. This is why an experimental approach of trial and error is so crucial _ trial-and-error _ and try again with a different approach.'Under Dyson's leadership, the company has developed multiple megahit home appliances from bag-less vacuum cleaners, cord-less stick vacuums, blade-less fans and hairdryers.Such new inventions did not come easily. Dyson said he went through thousands of failures developing the motors, which almost drove his family into bankruptcy.'Our 5,126 failures are very memorable episodes with lots of tears and sweat. I had my house hooked to the bank and was living on the edge of bankruptcy. My wife had to support the family by teaching art,' he said. 'The fun thing is you never really know what working on one problem may lead to. Often it can become the solution to something completely different and very exciting.'Under the concept of 'form follows function,' Dyson said the company considers design only as a part of its products. Based on this policy, Dyson's research, design and development (RDD) center hires engineers and scientists instead of industrial designers, according to the company's founder. Throughout the company, about a third of its 7,000 employees worldwide are engineers and scientists.'Good design is about how something works, not just how it looks,' he said.Dyson was born in a middle-income family in North Norfolk in Britain in 1947. He studied at the Royal College of Art in the 1960s and started his career as an engineer at an engineering company named Rotork.'Both my parents are classics teachers, and as a teenager I studied the classics but I had a love of painting on the side,' the 69-year-old engineer said. 'I stumbled into engineering when I was studying design at the Royal College of Art, taking a course on architecture and structural engineering.'Dyson said he decided to start his own company, inspired by British engineer Jeremy Fry.'He refused to fund a project I had in mind but offered me some work in design. I ended up working on a high speed landing craft _ the Sea Truck,' he said. 'I started with a plank of wood and had to turn the concept into a working boat. Under him, I learned the Edison approach _ making prototype after prototype until I got it right.'When he founded Dyson in 1993, its first product was the world's first bag-less vacuum cleaner named DC01. On the back of its massive hit in the global market, it has been highly praised as 'the biggest hit product in Britain after the Beatles.'Motor innovationAt the center of inventions at Dyson is its heavy concentration on research and development (R&D) of core technologies. Even though it started as a latecomer in the global electronics industry, Dyson pushed to develop its own motors, called Dyson digital motors (DDM), to use them for its devices.The Dyson chief engineer highlighted the concept of 'lean engineering' at the center of the company's R&D philosophy.'Lean engineering is to do more with less. We stick with this principle from the drawing board to the production line and to the shop shelf,' he said. 'Say, rather than adding material for strength, we look into the design and geometry to find other solutions to make the material stronger. It means we use far less material, it means the products are lighter and use less energy, which means we can put in more technology. That's what engineers do.'The company has invested over $360 million in building new DDMs. It runs a motor manufacturing facility named West Park in Singapore to produce more than 11 million DDMs every year.The latest inventions of the DDM series are the V8 and V9 motors. The former operates at 110,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and is used for its newest V8 vacuum cleaner series. The latter is a subminiature motor used for Dyson's bladeless hairdryer Supersonic.An engineer tests Dyson's Supersonic hairdryer at the company's R&D facility in Singapore. / Courtesy of DysonThe Dyson founder singled out the bladeless hairdryer as his favorite invention.'It is powered by our latest, smallest, lightest and most advanced digital V9 motor,' he said, 'The manufacturing of the V9 is very sophisticated, we had to import a nuclear-grade cutting machine all the way from Germany to Singapore to manufacture this motor. The V9 is half the weight and one third the size of a conventional motor. With V9 motor technology, we can create a light and powerful hair dryer with its weight balanced for your hands with intelligent heat control to protect the natural shine of hair.'Besides the V9 motor, Dyson has introduced a technology called 'air multiplier.' It is an air projection technology that boosts the amount of air by up to 18 times. This technology has also been used for its bladeless fans, Dyson said.Education and investment in young talented engineers has been another pillar of R&D policy at Dyson. The company has increased employment of less-experienced young college graduates.'I started off like that,' he said. 'When I was in college, I started making a high speed landing craft with no experience; I have always wanted to do the same for graduates. If you get them before they go anywhere else, you can mold them as they should be without having other influences.'I don't prefer the experienced. Experience means how something was done in the past, but we are doing new things so experience is not imperative,' he said.Dyson aims to double the size of its engineering team, which currently has some 2,000 experts, by 2020. To meet this goal, the company is striving to foster new engineers on its own by investing in education. It plans to launch what it calls the Dyson Institute of Technology at its R&D campus in Wiltshire. In this institute, young engineers can acquire their degrees in engineering while working for the company.'Hiring the brightest minds is crucial to our growth and we don't want the UK's engineer shortage to hold us back, we are looking to double our engineering force by 2020,' he said. 'That's why we have taken this problem into our own hands, and opened the Dyson Institute of Technology. Some 25 passionate students will come to our Malmesbury headquarters this September earning an engineering degree while working alongside seasoned engineers inside our RDD.'Dyson is also seeking technological breakthroughs by acquiring enterprises with core technologies. In October 2015, the company acquired U.S.-based battery development startup Sakti3.'We acquired Sakti3 in 2015 to supercharge our battery development,' he said. 'We share the same belief in developing core technology and together we will make the solid state battery a reality. We challenge ourselves to increase the density of today's most advanced liquid lithium ion batteries, while also being smaller, safer and longer lasting.'Korean marketDyson highlighted Korea as an important market with many tech-savvy consumers.'Korea is now the second fastest growing market for Dyson globally, and the growth is mainly driven by the love of the cord-free machines,' he said. 'Koreans are very sophisticated buyers, and love new technology and beautiful gadgets _ the Dyson Supersonic is also gaining a lot of popularity.'With its manufacturing base in Singapore, the company runs its Asian business from the country. Dyson said the company is 'not going to open an office in Korea anytime soon.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES (90%); VACUUM CLEANER MFG (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); ENGINEERING (90%); TECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (86%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MFG (77%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (77%); PRODUCT INNOVATION (77%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (73%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (67%); INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY (66%); FAMILY (66%)COMPANY: ROTORK PLC (51%)TICKER: ROR (LSE) (51%)INDUSTRY: NAICS333995 FLUID POWER CYLINDER & ACTUATOR MANUFACTURING (51%); SIC3593 FLUID POWER CYLINDERS & ACTUATORS (51%)PERSON: JAMES DYSON (93%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (52%)LOAD-DATE: March 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

A recent study led by the World Health Organization showed a new vaccine to be ""highly effective"" against the fatal disease, proving that even the most stubborn public health problems can be solved when the world's best minds work together.First identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ebola is spread through animal-to-human or human-to-human contact or through exposure to contaminated items such as linens or syringes. Sporadic outbreaks over the years culminated with an epidemic that began in 2014, killing more than 11,000 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Another 15 people, including one in the United States, were killed as the disease radiated from the three hot spots.As the scare intensified, hospitals across America rushed to prepare for it by checking their supplies of masks and other personal protection equipment and by quizzing patients with flu-like symptoms about recent travel outside the U.S. A nurse, Kaci Hickox, made headlines when she was quarantined against her will by New Jersey officials after returning from a humanitarian trip to Sierra Leone. She has sued the state, alleging violations of her constitutional rights.World health experts, including those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pooled resources in the search for a vaccine. The breakthrough was reported Dec. 23 by the WHO and various partners, who in 2015 began testing a vaccine in a part of Guinea still experiencing Ebola cases. The vaccine, administered to 5,837 people who were exposed in some manner to the disease, showed 100 percent effectiveness.Some questions about the vaccine's effectiveness, such as whether it works long-term, remain.

"271","Will BTS propel K-pop to the top?",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"January","Will BTS propel K-pop to the top?   THE KOREA HERALD January 1, 2018 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJanuary 1, 2018 MondayWill BTS propel K-pop to the top? LENGTH: 964 wordsIn 2012, Psy's 'Gangnam Style' took the world by storm, shattering YouTube records left and right while mesmerizing those around the world with its catchy beats and 'horse-riding' dance moves.Psy's success, however, failed to spill over to spark interest in other K-pop groups, as the song's popularity centered mostly on the hilarious music video and comic dance moves. It earned the artist's follow-up song 'Gentleman' a spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and over a billion views on YouTube, but that was it. The Psy sensation was no more -- a one-hit wonder, at least on the international stage.Five years later, another Korea-borne sensation rose to the top, this time in the form of boy band BTS. The group has had a formidable year, winning the top social artist award at Billboard Music Awards, and becoming the first K-pop group to perform at American Music Awards, with its song 'Mic Drop' cracking the Billboard Hot 100.But will it last? Key to successPundits attribute much of BTSï'success to its performances. The complicated, high-energy choreography is something rarely seen in today's pop music. 'There are a lot of groups with quality dance skills, but BTSï'moves are truly powerful. You can feel the passion in their performances, coupled with naturally-given talent,ï'said culture critic Lim Jin-mo. K-pop idols are known to go through years of hard training. In the book 'Being a Girl Group in Korea,ï'journalist Lee Hak-jun shows that idol singers are trained so that even when they are woken up in the middle of a night and told to dance, they are expected to do it flawlessly. Whether such harsh training is ideal is up for debate, but the effect cannot be doubted. The sight of seven men dancing in perfect harmony with machine-like precision is truly a sight to behold.In addition to the dances, BTS is known to deliver thought-provoking messages with which youngsters around the world can empathize.'Korea and US, we have our different languages but we all share similar thoughts. ... We may talk in different tongues, but we're thankful that you (the fans) identify themselves with us,ï'member Suga said on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Showï'in November.Kim Yo-han, a student at Kyung Hee University's department of performing arts, wrote in his paper that BTSï'popularity with young fans comes from its songwriting that represents the struggling youth.'Even before its debut, BTS ran a blog to upload their freestyle rap, songs, mix tapes and work logs to establish their own musical world. BTS then released three albums with the concept of 'Story of teens by teens.'... BTS wrote their own stories into their albums, which young fans were able to follow,ï'he wrote in his paper 'Competence of idol groups based on their songwriting abilities.'But the biggest factor of all perhaps, is how BTS used social media. From very early on in their careers, each member of the BTS sought to communicate and establish a wholesome and familiar image for the fans. BTSï'active use of social media allowed it to become an online powerhouse. The loyal fan base, known as ARMY, played a great part in the process as well, promoting the band throughout the internet both locally and internationally. Culture Critic Kwon Sang-hee said the online communication with the fans played a huge part in building such a solid fan base. 'Through SNS, (ARMY) fans reached beyond borders to expand the fan base. They were not only consumers, but producers of BTS as well,ï'she wrote in her column. 'There was also the underlying efforts put in by BTS. Their method of sharing each and every detail of their personal lives -- from their meals, practice sessions to backstage (clips) -- 'disarmsï'the fans with intimacy, instead of approaching them as 'idols.'ï'Not overnight sensationBTSï'success looks a lot like Psy's, in that it is heavily based on Billboard and happened within a very short span of time. But evidence suggests that the group will outlast its novelty factor.While 'Gangnam Styleï'was wildly popular, not many of the millions of followers worldwide were transformed to Psy fans. The K-pop artist was looked upon as the funny guy doing funny moves in a funny music video, and was often eclipsed by the popularity of his own song. BTS, however, managed to build a sizeable fan base in the Western world as well as back home in Korea. The popularity of 'Mic Drop,ï'which peaked at No. 28 in the Billboard Hot 100 in November, attest to that. It was released after BTS had already been invited to perform in the AMA and BBMA. The song -- which remains the most popular BTS song in the West to date -- did not fuel BTSï'popularity; it was the other way around. Experts say that BTSï'popularity is likely to have a carryover effect on other K-pop groups as well. This is because unlike Psy, who was an oddity in the K-pop scene, BTS is a 'typicalï'K-pop group, armed with fancy looks, flashy choreography and fluent attitude. 'Psy's popularity really depended on the funny, cheesy kind of feeling the fans got,ï'said critic Lim. 'BTS is not like that. It takes its music seriously, represents a generation. Not only that, it is very typical of a K-pop group; an idol dance group.'In a way, BTS represents what K-pop is really like. When people look at BTS, they get a pretty good idea of what K-pop is like. ... I think the success of BTS can at least have some positive impact on other K-pop groups.

By Kwon Mee-yooHuh Dong-hwa, director of the Museum of Korean Embroidery, believes Korean 'bojagi' (traditional wrapping cloth) will someday be recognized as abstract art, just like Korean modern art pioneer Kim Whan-ki's paintings.It is no coincidence that the 91-year-old collector and artist Huh is holding a solo exhibition at the Whanki Museum, which is dedicated to the late artist Kim.Titled ""Huh Dong-hwa: Abundance,"" the retrospective captures the unique esthetic sense of Huh, inspired by his extensive collection of antiques and nature.Huh is better known as an avid collector, who specializes in Korean traditional costumes, embroidery and other fabric items. He runs the Museum of Korean Embroidery in southern Seoul, which displays a thematic selection from Huh's collection, which reaches up to 3,000 items, on rotation.The collection also bridged Huh and the Whanki Museum, when the museum held an exhibition of Korean beauty in relation to Kim Whank-ki's art, featuring fabrics from Huh's collection and wooden furniture from the National Folk Museum of Korea.Holding an exhibit of Huh's work is part of the Whanki Museum's new effort, embracing artists from diverse backgrounds.""We started researching Huh's artworks, aside from his collection, as Huh is an artist who discovers creative sides from everyday life and suggests a new artistic perspective,"" said Sung Min-a, a curator of the Whanki Museum.Huh is not a typical artist who was trained professionally at an art school. Instead, he developed his own aesthetic values as he collected Korean antiques, especially colorful bojagi.""Huh is an artist out of the systemized context of the art world. However, his works represent nature, tradition and daily life. It reflects his values, bringing art closer to our lives,"" Sung said. ""Huh's works might seem unrefined at first, but they are based on auteurism.""Huh Dong-hwa's ""Fruition""Huh Dong-hwa's ""Forest""Some 500 pieces - including painting, collage, assemblage, metalworks and brooches - are on display at the three-story museum and these are only about half of Huh's oeuvre.The first floor is an introduction to the exhibit as well as Huh's artistic world, featuring his major paintings and collage works. A 2008 work 'Fruition' has a bunch of brooches pasted onto a painting of a tree, symbolizing Huh's love of nature and beauty.The half moon-shaped gallery is like a salon and visitors to the museum can enjoy Huh's fabric collage on a traditional door frame while sitting on a chair.A tall room located next to the stairs showcases a collection of handmade brooches and silk collage works displayed in the shape of a stained-glass window, as a nod to the prayer room-like atmosphere of the exhibition space.Huh Dong-hwa's fabric collage on traditional wooden door gratingsPaintings and collages on the second floor represents Huh's use of colors. The paintings have unique textures as the artist sometimes squeezes paint out of tube onto the canvas, creating clumps of paints. Huh uses bold colors and geometric shapes to portray imagery of nature as well as his life.Fabric collage works have profound colors coming from natural dyeing, which cannot be achieved by paints. Ranging from vivid red and blue to delicate yellow and green, Huh matched the scraps of fabrics in free yet rhythmic arrangement.""The sense of color expressed in Huh's works could be related to typical color field abstract or abstract expressionism, but it is rather unique, coming from the discernment trained by traditional colors,"" the curator said.Huh's signature brooches made from recycled jewels and objects are displayed on a canvas. 'Each brooch has independent charm, but we wanted to present the brooches in a way showing the flow of his perspective. So instead of displaying each in a showcase, we placed them on a canvas to relate better to all of them,' Sung said.Huh Dong-hwa's assemblage ""Family,"" left, and ""Big Family""The Whanki Museum's third-floor gallery has a large window with a view of Inwang Mountain. Huh's assemblage featuring old farming tools goes well with the nature of the area.""He is a collector as well as an artist. His works have been created over a long time and reflect the flow of time,"" Sung said.Inspired by the shapes of the agricultural equipment, Huh tells the story of Korean traditions in an engaging way. Rusty spoons become a family in a frame and bells become peonies on an old tree.Huh's fabric collage on traditional wooden door gratings speak an abstract, geometric visual language using line and color in a geometric way.In spite of his great age, Huh is still an active artist. His latest interest is creating large-scale metal sculptures. ""Metal is a material I haven't worked with before,"" Huh said.

This represents 500 additional 'new jobs,' or an annual 50 percent increase compared with the preceding years.The company said that its hiring plan is aimed at providing quality jobs and securing talent for the forthcoming Fourth Industrial Revolution. This strikes a unique path of fighting overseas protectionism and dealing with automation, which many firms feel tempted to use as excuses for outsourcing and restructuring that entails reducing payrolls. In addition, it also shows POSCO is ready to act as a more responsible corporate citizen by doing something to address one of the great challenges our society faces _ the reduction of decent jobs.Also, the company plans to apply a 'blind hiring' method _ for example there will be no discrimination by majors the aspirants studied in college. This is for two reasons _ first hiring the best pool of talent, and second easing the difficulties facing graduates with diplomas in the social sciences and humanities.But the appealing part in the POSCO hiring plan is for it to lighten the work load for its employees, helping them attain a work and life balance. Koreans are one of the longest working peoples with their work and life out of balance. This is due to the fact that despite the marked improvement in the nation's economy, corporate culture is still stuck in the development era _ dictating individual sacrifice for that of the group.This can't be sustainable. Already, many side effects such as a low birthrate and uneven income distribution are suffocating the vibrancy that the economy needs. True, there is speculation that it was a 'political' act by POSCO Chairman Kwon Oh-joon to curry favor with President Moon Jae-in. Critics may argue that this boosted hiring may not be good for shareholders.No matter. Big firms have hired far fewer people than what is called for by profits they make from society.

"276","Xi warns party to tackle challenges as China moves into new 'modern socialist' era '",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"October","Xi warns party to tackle challenges as China moves into new 'modern socialist' era '  Korea Times October 19, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesOctober 19, 2017 ThursdayXi warns party to tackle challenges as China moves into new 'modern socialist' era 'LENGTH: 1442 wordsChinese President Xi Jinping has declared China has entered a new phase to create a 'modern socialist country'.By SCMP StaffChinese President Xi Jinping mapped out a confident vision of China's rise as a global power by 2050, opening a twice-a-decade party gathering on Wednesday by reaffirming the Communist Party's continued control and pledging the start of a 'new era'.In one of his most important political addresses since taking power five years ago and underscoring his own pivotal role since then, Xi declared China had entered a new phase to create a 'modern socialist country', a declaration analysts saw as a prelude to the omnipresent party-state under his governing philosophy.'Right now both China and the world are in the midst of profound and complex changes,' he told more than 2,300 delegates at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.'China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development. The prospects are bright, but the challenges are severe.'In an all-encompassing, 3¨ö-hour speech that will set the tone for the country's development over the next decade, Xi urged the party to tackle these severe challenges, from widespread corruption and imbalances in the economy to mounting social unrest and a long list of other social and environmental woes.Despite criticism of his tightening grip on power and narrowing space for civil society, Xi signalled his confidence that relatively high economic growth combined with deepening reforms and better income distribution, a continuing crackdown on corruption and the shaping of its political system on its own terms would engender the party's legitimacy.Xi appeared to be more ambitious than his predecessors, as he unveiled a two-stage plan to transform China into a 'great modern socialist country' by mid-century. Under the plan, China will realise a moderately prosperous society by 2020 and socialist modernisation by 2035. China would become a modern socialist power that was 'prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful' by 2050.Observers said this was the first time the party had set out a post-2020 plan.Amid widespread speculation that his development philosophy will be enshrined in the party's constitution at the end of the week-long congress ? giving him the same stature as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping ? Xi said the country had formed 'thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era'.In separate panel meetings with provincial delegates, Politburo Standing Committee members Zhang Dejiang, Liu Yunshan and Yu Zhengsheng labelled these ideas as 'Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics for the new era', hinting at their impending elevation into the constitution.In a politically choreographed show of unity, former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao followed Xi as he walked into the hall, flanking him at the rostrum while dozens of party elders rarely seen in public in recent years were seated in the same row.Xi conceded during the televised event that the survival of one-party rule would be decided largely by the fight against corruption, which remained 'grave and complex' despite the much-touted success in snaring a long list of corrupt officials.'The people resent corruption most "" Only by intensifying efforts to address both the symptoms and causes of corruption "" can we avoid history's cycle of rise and fall and ensure the long-term stability of the party and the country,' he said.Xi struck a nationalistic chord throughout his speech, calling for the party to not only safeguard China's sovereignty but also to assert itself in every possible aspect of Chinese people's lives in an ideological crusade to crush any attempts to undermine the party leadership or copy Western-style democracy.'No one political system should be regarded as the only choice, and we should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,' he said.Xi also pledged further controls on the media and the internet while strengthening the country's soft power, such as building more think tanks 'with Chinese characteristics' and promoting so-called socialist moral values.'The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is no walk in the park or mere drumbeating and gong-clanging. The whole party must be prepared to make ever more difficult and harder efforts,' he said.Stressing that a nation would prosper only if its youth were allowed to thrive, he said: 'To all our young people, you should have firm ideals and convictions, aim high, and have your feet firmly on the ground.'He also said China would push for innovation and give priority to projects such as genetic technology.Xi listed his bold military reforms, the strengthening of one-party rule, poverty reduction, and Beijing's controversial push for artificial island construction in the disputed South China Sea as topping his trophy list over the past five years.He also touted China's 'Belt and Road Initiative' to revive trade along the old Silk Road and maritime routes as having 'created a favourable environment for the country's overall development'.He stressed the party's absolute control of the armed forces, adding that the aim of military reform was to realise modernisation by 2035 and to transform the People's Liberation Army into a world-class outfit by 2050. 'A military is built to fight,' he said.Military analysts said Xi was yet again underlining his ambition to turn the PLA into a modern fighting force with a combat capability comparable to its US counterpart.'This is a new 15-year plan initiated by Xi to use the country's growing economic clout to push for a stronger PLA, which is aimed at making China a global military power like the US around 2049,' Hong Kong-based military observer Liang Guoliang said.Amid concerns and suspicion about the intention behind China's rise and his plan to build a world-class military in the next three decades, Xi pledged that Beijing would never seek regional hegemony or an expansionist policy at the expense of other countries.'China will never advance itself at the expense of the interests of other nations, but we will never give up our lawful rights,' he said. 'No one could expect us to swallow consequences that damage our sovereignty, security and developmental interests.'At the same time, 'China will continue its efforts to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development, and uphold international order', he said.Xi highlighted the mounting uncertainties and challenges facing the world, such as regional and economic instability, a widening wealth gap, terrorism, major epidemics, cyberspace insecurity and climate change.In a reference to rising protectionism and anti-globalisation sentiment in the United States and Europe, and America's declining global leadership under President Donald Trump, Xi said: 'No country alone can handle all sorts of challenges that humanity faces and no country can slide back into isolation.'Setting out a new relationship with Hong Kong, he said the high degree of autonomy that the city enjoyed would be coupled with the central leadership's 'comprehensive jurisdiction'.Without naming Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, Xi vowed to crush any attempts to separate Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province, from the mainland.Beijing would not allow 'any individual, any organisation, any political party, at any time or by any means, to split any single piece of the Chinese territory', he vowed, to rapturous applause from the delegates.Xi pledged that China would continue to open up, grant greater market access to foreign investors, make state-owned enterprises bigger and stronger, deepen financial reforms and fend off systemic financial risks.'Development remains the foundation and the key to all the problems China faces,' he said.He also raised the need for wealth distribution, environmental protection and poverty reduction, identifying the widening income gap as one of the grave issues that had not been adequately addressed.He promised to extend land-use contracts for farmers for another 30 years after expiration, to motivate them to invest in collectively owned land.Christopher Balding, associate professor at Peking University's HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, said it was a bit confusing to read into a speech packed with political slogans and cliches.'One of the things that's going to be very interesting is, what does it mean going forward and how do [the slogans] play out in practice for China's development? Right now I don't think anybody really knows,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (89%); POLITICS (89%); EMERGING MARKETS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (76%); INCOME DISTRIBUTION (72%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (72%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (70%); CORRUPTION (65%)PERSON: XI JINPING (94%); HU JINTAO (59%)CITY: BEIJING, CHINA (74%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: CHINA (99%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: October 19, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Chung, 64, served as a co-head of the People??s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a liberal civic group, from 2010-2016. She also headed the Korean Women??s Association United from 2002-2007.Cheong Wa Dae expressed hopes for the nominee to take a lead in improving working conditions for women and boosting support for the youth to help create a safe and healthy environment for them. ??I heavily feel a sense of responsibility and duty as a nominee under the administration which is strongly determined to achieve gender equality,?? she said. ??Gender equality is a core value that cannot be pushed back anymore for the happiness and safety of the public and the sustainable future of South Korea.??As a sitting history professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, Chung is also viewed as having expertise on how to handle the controversial agreement with Japan on the wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II. She has attended a demonstration on Wednesdays in front of the Japanese Embassy in central Seoul alongside victims of the sex slavery, calling for annulment of the deal. The presidential office initially said that Chung was to handle ??urgent?? affairs such as a ??renegotiation?? over the Korea-Japan deal on sex slavery when it announced her as the nominee. But it withdrew the term ??renegotiation?? about an hour later in an apparent attempt not to provoke diplomatic tensions.President Moon Jae-in hinted at renegotiations over the deal on his presidential campaign trail, saying Japan needs to take legal responsibility and offer an official apology. But he has not yet made it official on whether to launch a renegotiation with Japan. Born in Busan, Chung graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in history education an earned a master??s degree in western history there.

"278","[Herald Interview] BBC journalist Francine Stock talks about Korean films? richness, complexity and honesty",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","[Herald Interview] BBC journalist Francine Stock talks about Korean films? richness, complexity and honesty   THE KOREA HERALD August 30, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 30, 2017 Wednesday[Herald Interview] BBC journalist Francine Stock talks about Korean films? richness, complexity and honesty LENGTH: 502 wordsFrancine Stock, a broadcaster for BBC Television and Radio and formerly a movie critic, has been enthralled by the richness and delicacy of Korean films, ever since they began to make waves in her country about a decade ago. Having previously interviewed Korean director Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho as a host of BBC Radio 4, Stock said globally acclaimed Korean films such as 'Thirst' and ??The Handmaiden,?? both directed by Park, have paved the way for Korean cinema in England. ??There are some special elements in Korean films that appeal to the British sensibility. There has been a prejudice that Korean films may display similar factors of Japanese culture, but they??re not like them at all,?? said Stock during an interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul on Tuesday. ??Take ??Thirst?? for an example. Although its genre is horror and based on a French novel, the film features huge amount of emotions depicted by director Park??s original way,?? she added. In addition to combining strong cinematic characters and narratives together, Korean directors know how to weave the warmth, humor and humanity into their works, according to Stock. In British films, violence is often described almost like a choreography or ballet with the aid of visual and sound effects. But Korean films show the violence as it is, so that people can actually feel the vivid anger from the movie and even get hurt by it, said Stock. Stock also said she was deeply impressed by how director Bong??s international project ??Okja?? successfully showed that films could become a measure of ??cultural diplomacy?? by raising questions on global issues such as international food production, globalization and the eating of animals. Stock stated it was worrisome to see how the current film industries lack originality, as they keep reverting back to old habits and reproducing past successes. But recently she felt glad that movies like Christopher Nolan??s ??Dunkirk?? showed that there are different ways to make a movie outside of the traditional mold. ??There??s this running idea among major filmmakers, ??Let??s make another one similar to that successful one before.?? But international audiences are different these days in that they are not waiting for another superhero sequel anymore, because they see those movies are all the same,?? said Stock.She stressed that more investment should be made into creating good films and distributing them, while most movie distributers around the world rather focus on marketing the films. Stock, who joined BBC in 1983, has fronted a range of arts and current affairs programs for BBC Television and Radio, including ??Newsnight?? and ??Front Row.?? Since 2004, she has been presenting a weekly radio show called ??The Film Programme.?? Stock has also published two novels: ??A Foreign Country?? in 1999 and ??Man-made Fibre?? in 2002, as well as the nonfiction ??In Glorious Technicolor: a Century of Film and How it has Shaped Us?? in 2011.

Comprehensive thinking and creative perspectives are crucial in order to adapt to this environment.For decades, design has been the core engine in driving convergence among industries. In an era of technological pervasiveness, a deep probe into the human aspects of design is key. Throughout three sessions, taking place Tuesday at the Shilla Seoul's Dynasty Hall, global minds in design will share their perspectives on the pivotal role that emotional, human elements will play in design in the tech-intensive era. Imbuing objects with emotion The first session titled 'Design For Humanityï'begins at 9:20 a.m. and features three product designers who find ways to imbue objects with human feeling. ã€€Spanish artist and designer Jaime Hayon of Hayon Studio, dedicated to projects that range from art installations and interior design to product design, will question how central functionality is to product design.ã€€Known for his whimsical sensibility, the 43-year-old Spanish designer has gained acclaim for quirky yet meticulous pieces like 'Green Chicken,ï'a bright, poultry-shaped rocking chair. Hayon will be discussing what commerciality means in product design, and how the fundamental role of the designer should be to enhance human happiness. ã€€Japanese designer Naoto Fukasawa, 61, is the mind behind some of the exquisitely simple everyday objects of lifestyle brand Muji. Fukasawa will talk about how to visualize what people think, imagine and wonder about, in addition to the harmony between human beings and technology.ã€€Italian architect-designer Claudio Bellini has designed iconic pieces of furniture such as Venice, a table made from Venetian wood that visualizes the city's waters with a glass tabletop. Bellini will emphasize the spirit of research in today's fast-paced world, along with the importance of human vision. Staying sensitive to people's needsThe second session titled 'Design Thinkingï'begins at 1 p.m. and will invite Carme Pigem, Seok Yong-bae and Aernout Dijkstra-Hellinga to the stage.ã€€World-renowned Spanish architect Pigem, whose firm won the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize this year, will discuss the need for harmony between humans, environment and structure in architecture. Pigem's firm RCR Arquitectes, which additionally consists of architects Ramon Vilalta and Rafael Aranda, was lauded for bringing together the environment, history and humanity in its constructions.ã€€Korean designer Seok Yong-bae is an automobile designer-turned-shoe designer who has collaborated with numerous international luxury brands. His work has branched out into lifestyle, fashion and interior design, taking on forms as diverse as his experiences in Europe's fashion industry. Seok will be introducing cases where inter-industry collaborations birthed new creative changes, and the 'soft powerï'of design. Dijkstra-Hellinga is the senior lead designer and vice president of sustainability at Bugaboo, a Dutch mobility company that specializes in strollers and luggage. Dijkstra-Hellinga will be discussing the unique aspects of mobility design and the detailed attention required to pick up on consumer needs. How technology plays into the gameThe third session is titled 'The Design 4.0: New Normal Design Economyï'and begins at 3:40 p.m. Speaking at the session will be George Popescu, Sung Jung-gi and Terao Gen. ã€€Popescu is the CEO and cofounder of Lampix, an augmented reality technology platform, among many of his other ventures. Popescu will discuss how augmented reality engages human senses in deeper ways than ever before, and how it has opened up a new world of content creation and experience. ã€€Also speaking will be Sung Jung-gi, the first Korean designer at US design company Ideo, and the creative director of Daylight, a human-centered design company that creates products such as kid-friendly smart goods. ã€€Gen Terao, the self-taught Japanese designer who launched his design company Balmuda in 2003, will ask and answer fundamental questions such as 'What is a good object?ï'and 'What does it mean to run a good company?ï'ã€€Since its founding, Balmuda has received attention for products such as its multi-function toaster, which acts as a mini oven for various types of food, and the cordless, swiveling electric fan titled 'GreenFan.ï'ã€€Additional events include a lecture for architecture students given by Pigem, which will take place at 10 a.m. at the Yeong Bin Gwan Ruby room.

Davis, who has been in city jails for four-and-half years, insisted it was self-defense against Han Ki-suck, 58, who had accosted him in the city's 49th Street subway station.Jury forewoman Gretchen Pfeil, who teaches linguistic anthropology at New York University, said after the verdict: 'I think the vast majority of us from the beginning of our deliberations believed the prosecution had failed to prove the defendant was not justified in his actions. And by the end of our deliberations, I believe we were of one mind that he was in fact justified in his actions.'About 12:30 p.m. on December 3, 2012, Han, who was drunk, accosted and swore at Davis, a homeless refugee, after they accidentally bumped into each other near a turnstile.Han followed Davis down to the subway platform and kept harassing him, grabbing his shoulder. Davis, frustrated, shoved him away, causing the Korean to fall onto the tracks.Han was too drunk to climb back and a train crushed him to death a few minutes later. Davis reportedly 'freaked' and fled, according to the Daily Mail.The incident received wide attention after The New York Post showed a photo of Han about to be crushed by the train, headlined 'Doomed.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (92%); DEATH & DYING (90%); MANSLAUGHTER (90%); JURY TRIALS (90%); RAIL STATIONS & TERMINALS (89%); CITY LIFE (78%); TRAINS (78%); VERDICTS (76%); HOMICIDE (76%); ACQUITTAL (76%); MURDER (76%); WITNESSES (76%); INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (75%); TESTIMONY (74%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); NEGLIGENCE (70%); REFUGEES (65%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (52%); LINGUISTICS (52%)COMPANY: NEW YORK RESTAURANT GROUP INC (92%)INDUSTRY: SIC5812 EATING PLACES (92%)CITY: NEW YORK, NY, USA (92%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (93%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: July 19, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"284","Inconvenient truths about migration",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"November","Inconvenient truths about migration  Korea Times November 23, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesNovember 23, 2017 ThursdayInconvenient truths about migrationBYLINE: By Robert SkidelskyLENGTH: 1046 wordsLONDON - Sociology, anthropology, and history have been making large inroads into the debate on immigration. It seems that Homo economicus, who lives for bread alone, has given way to someone for whom a sense of belonging is at least as important as eating. This makes one doubt that hostility to mass immigration is simply a protest against job losses, depressed wages, and growing inequality. Economics has certainly played a part in the upsurge of identity politics, but the crisis of identity will not be expunged by economic reforms alone. Economic welfare is not the same as social wellbeing.Let's start, though, with the economics, using the United Kingdom ? now heading out of the EU ? as a case in point. Between 1991 and 2013 there was a net inflow of 4.9 million foreign-born migrants into Britain.Standard economic theory tells us that net inward migration, like free trade, benefits the native population only after a lag. The argument here is that if you increase the quantity of labor, its price (wages) falls. This will increase profits. The increase in profits leads to more investment, which will increase demand for labor, thereby reversing the initial fall in wages. Immigration thus enables a larger population to enjoy the same standard of living as the smaller population did before a clear improvement in total welfare.A recent study by Cambridge University economist Robert Rowthorn, however, has shown that this argument is full of holes. The so-called temporary effects in terms of displaced native workers and lower wages may last five or ten years, while the beneficial effects assume an absence of recession. And, even with no recession, if there is a continuing inflow of migrants, rather than a one-off increase in the size of the labor force, demand for labor may constantly lag behind growth in supply. The 'claim that immigrants take jobs from local workers and push down their wages,' Rowthorn argues, 'may be exaggerated, but it is not always false.'A second economic argument is that immigration will rejuvenate the labor force and stabilize public finances, because young, imported workers will generate the taxes required to support a rising number of pensioners. The UK population is projected to surpass 70 million before the end of the next decade, an increase of 3.6 million, or 5.5%, owing to net immigration and a surplus of births over deaths among the newcomers.Rowthorn dismisses this argument. 'Rejuvenation through immigration is an endless treadmill,' he says. 'To maintain a once-and-for-all reduction in the dependency ratio requires a never-ending stream of immigrants. Once the inflow stops, the age structure will revert to its original trajectory.' A lower inflow and a higher retirement age would be a much better solution to population aging.Thus, even with optimal outcomes, like the avoidance of recession, the economic arguments for large-scale immigration are hardly conclusive. So the crux of the matter is really its social impact. Here, the familiar benefit of diversity confronts the downside risk of a loss of social cohesion.David Goodhart, former editor of the journal Prospect, has argued the case for restriction from a social democratic perspective. Goodhart takes no position on whether cultural diversity is intrinsically or morally good or bad. He simply takes it for granted that most people prefer to live with their own kind, and that policymakers must attend to this preference. A laissez-faire attitude to the composition of a country's population is as untenable as indifference to its size.For Goodhart, the taproot of liberals' hostility to migration controls is their individualist view of society. Failing to comprehend people's attachment to settled communities, they label hostility to immigration irrational or racist.Liberal over-optimism about the ease of integrating migrants stems from the same source: if society is no more than a collection of individuals, integration is a non-issue. Of course, says Goodhart, immigrants do not have to abandon their traditions completely, but 'there is such a thing as society,' and if they make no effort to join it, native citizens will find it hard to consider them part of the 'imagined community.'A too-rapid inflow of immigrants weakens bonds of solidarity, and, in the long run, erodes the affective ties required to sustain the welfare state. 'People will always favor their own families and communities,' Goodhart argues, and 'it is the task of a realistic liberalism to strive for a definition of community that is wide enough to include people from many different backgrounds, without being so wide as to become meaningless.'Economic and political liberals are bedfellows in championing unrestricted immigration. Economic liberals view national frontiers as irrational obstacles to the global integration of markets. Many political liberals regard nation-states and the loyalties they inspire as obstacles to the wider political integration of humanity. Both appeal to moral obligations that stretch far beyond nations' cultural and physical boundaries.At issue is the oldest debate in the social sciences. Can communities be created by politics and markets, or do they presuppose a prior sense of belonging?It seems to me that anyone who thinks about such matters is bound to agree with Goodhart that citizenship, for most people, is something they are born into. Values are grown from a specific history and geography. If the make-up of a community is changed too fast, it cuts people adrift from their own history, rendering them rootless. Liberals' anxiety not to appear racist hides these truths from them. An explosion of what is now called populism is the inevitable result.The policy conclusion to be drawn is banal, but worth restating. A people's tolerance for change and adaptation should not be strained beyond its limits, different though these will be in different countries. Specifically, immigration should not be pressed too far, because it will be sure to ignite hostility. Politicians who fail to 'control the borders' do not deserve their people's trust.Robert Skidelsky, a member of the British House of Lords, is Professor Emeritus of Political Economy at Warwick University.

Akin to generics of chemical drugs, biosimilars refer to cheaper, near-replicas of live cell biologic drugs whose patents have expired.(Samsung Bioepis)Renflexis is the second Remicade-referencing biosimilar to score approval by the US regulator. The agency had approved Korea-based Celltrion's Inflectra in April last year, paving the way for the firm's marketing partner Pfizer to start selling the drug in the US from November.""Through relentless process innovation and an uncompromising commitment to quality, we remain committed to advancing one of the industry's strongest biosimilar pipelines,"" Samsung Bioepis spokesperson Hyun Min-gi said.With the new approval, J&J's Remicade   the firm's topselling drug with annual sales of around $5 billion   will now be competing against two cheaper alternative infliximab drugs in the US.Samsung Bioepis' Renflexis will be sold and marketed in the US via the firm's local partner Merck & Co, also known as MSD. The firms have yet to announce a price scheme for its new biosimilar.Meanwhile, Pfizer has priced Inflectra 15 percent cheaper than the originator drug in the US, and has been steadily eating into Pfizer's market share in the country over the past few months.Remicade's US sales fell 2.4 percent on-year to $1.18 billion in the first quarter of this year, while worldwide sales dropped 6 percent on-year to $1.67 billion during the period, according to J&J's quarterly earnings report.Renflexis is likely to begin sales from late this year, as companies are required to wait 180 days after approval to begin selling a biosimilar, according to the latest interpretation of local US regulations governing the new biologic drug category.The two Remicade-referencing biosimilars approved in the US have already launched in additional markets including major European countries, Australia, Canada as well as Korea.Celltrion has been selling Inflectra under the name Remsima in Europe since 2014, while Samsung Bioepis began selling Renflexis in the region under the name Flixabi from 2016 via its marketing partner and minority shareholder Biogen.The Korean drugmakers have already introduced or are awaiting regulatory approval for biosimilars referencing other blockbuster drugs sold worldwide.Celltrion's Rituxan (rituximab) biosimilar, Truxima, has scored approval from the European Medicines Agency and has begun sales in the region. It is seeking the EMA's approval of its Herceptin (trastuzumab) biosimilar, Herzuma, as well.Samsung Bioepis has also commercialized a biosimilar referencing Amgen's Enbrel (etanercept) via Biogen in European markets, Australia, Canada and Korea. It is currently awaiting the EMA's approval of its biosimilars referencing Herceptin as well as Humira (adalimumab).A biosimilar referencing Lantus (insulin glargine), developed by MSD with partial funding from Samsung Bioepis, obtained the EMA's approval in January this year, and has begun sales in the region under the name Lusduna.ã  Samsung Bioepis is 93.3 percent owned by Kospi-listed Samsung BioLogics, a contract manufacturer of biologic drugs developed by clients including Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The remainder of the shares are held by US-based Biogen.The two Samsung units are at the heart of Samsung Group's push into biopharmaceuticals as it seeks leadership in new, promising sectors beyond its flagship electronics business.Samsung Bioepis had sought to pursue an initial public offering on the US-based Nasdaq in 2015, yet postponed its plans citing market volatility.

"287","Gwangju: The 1st Asian Literature Festival",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"November","Gwangju: The 1st Asian Literature Festival  Korea Times November 7, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesNovember 7, 2017 TuesdayGwangju: The 1st Asian Literature FestivalBYLINE: By Brother AnthonyLENGTH: 1269 wordsNobel Prize laureate Wole Soyinka from Nigeria speaks at Asian Literature Festival in Gwangju, Nov. 4. / YonhapGWANGJU _ The vast, recently completed Asia Culture Center in the heart of Gwangju, South Jeolla Province, was the scene of Korea's first Asian Literature Festival last week, Nov. 1 to 4. It brought together writers from Asia and beyond, together with a number of Korean writers, for a time of sharing and encounters designed to establish stronger bonds between writers across the globe. In his opening remarks, the senior Korean poet, Ko Un, stressed until now the sheer size of the region known as 'Asia,' together with its linguistic diversity, have been a great obstacle to free communications between the writers of the region. Korean poets have remained unaware of and unable to read the poetry written in other countries and on other continents, and vice versa. Ko Un recalled how the Korean poet Oh Sang-sun wrote a poem titled 'Asia's Night' in 1920, in the aftermath of Japan's suppression of the Korean March 1 Independence Movement. He proposed poets coming together now in friendship might be able to produce, nearly a century later, a response he called 'Asia's Morning.'In his opening address, the 1986 Nobel Prize laureate Wole Soyinka from Nigeria stressed that humanity today faces a vital choice between freedom and stagnation. Creativity, he said, is only possible in freedom and today, in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, fundamentalist religious intolerance is resulting not only in the destruction of many nations' artistic heritage but in the uprooting and scattering of whole populations. In response, he called for the festival's participants to work together to develop a new 'Culture of Peace,' binding 'all peoples together from Africa to Korea and around the globe.'The Asia Culture Center was built around and under the former Jeolla Provincial Office and other buildings on Geumnam-ro Street, which today form a memorial complex to the victims of the 5.18 Democratic Uprising. It was the site of the final massacre of the civilian militia when the army retook control of the town in the early morning of May 27, 1980. President Roh Moo-hyun first suggested turning the site into a cultural center for the whole of Asia. It was only natural that the festival participants should begin by making a solemn visit to the May 18th National Cemetery, led by Ko Un, and together pay their respects to all who lived and died for Korea's democratization, in 1980 and also both before and since then. Ko Un paid special tribute to poets Kim Nam-ju and Jo Tae-il and activist Yun Han-bong. In the Memorial Hall at the cemetery the visitors saw a special display of poems selected from Ko Un's great 'Maninbo' cycle, commemorating some of those who died in the Uprising.A number of poets from across the world spoke during the festival. The great Spanish poet Antonio Colinas said, in particular, 'The poems and prose of the East possess literary and vital roots, about which we still need to learn, of which we must perform a radical reading to escape the chaos toward which we are heading.' He concluded, 'The poetry of the past has lasted and must endure today in the face of the uniformity and chaos that foments global dehumanization. This was possible because the poetry of the past has been faithful to its primary mission, to go beyond words.'French poet Claude Mouchard evoked his encounter with a homeless Sudanese refugee in France; finally that man lived for eight years in his home and they struggled to communicate despite the language barriers. Mouchard took scraps of their shared conversations and turned them into poetry. The man one day died of a heart attack in the poet's arms, but his words remain, noted by the poet as 'perhaps poems.' American poet Zack Rogow traced the influence of Asian poetry and art, especially that of Japan, to the writers and artists of France and Russia.That evening, Ko Un and singer Na Yoon-sun joined forces in a concert, Ko Un's dramatic readings of his poems alternating with the vibrant voice of the immensely popular singer before a packed theater. Ko Un's manner of reading his poems has long made him a celebrity in literary festivals across the globe and at 84 he continues to impress and deeply move audiences.At the heart of the festival were poets and novelists from a number of Asian countries: Ayu Utami from Indonesia, Damdinsuren Uriankhai from Mongolia, Duo Duo from China, Sagawa Aki from Japan and Shams Langeroodi from Iran, as well as a dozen writers, mostly poets, from Korea. Each of the overseas guests was accompanied by a personal interpreter to facilitate communication. During visits to the top of Mount Mudeung, to the bamboo groves and a traditional garden in Damyang, freewheeling exchanges formed the essence of the festival, as poet met poet across the barriers of distance and language. One literary translator spoke on the last day to stress the essential role of the translator in enabling multiple local literatures written in so many mutually incomprehensible languages to cross all frontiers and become truly 'Asian literature' and 'world literature.'A jury had screened in advance the work of the foreign participants and the first Asian Literary Award was given to Damdinsuren Uriankhai from Mongolia, whose work combines traditional nomadic poetry with modern, more universal features in a remarkable way. Always dressed in traditional Mongolian robes, his calm smile and warm presence were especially impressive throughout the festival. He received his award from the hands of the poet Do Jong-hwan, who is the current minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism.The climax of the festival came with the keynote speech by Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka on Saturday afternoon. In it he said, 'We know that when we set out into the realms of imagination, we experience liberation at its most unsullied. We are not only free, we see humanity as the very repository and expression of freedom, beyond doctrine and politics.' He evoked the many ways in which power has always felt threatened by the freedom of creativity, and striven to crush it, whether in the Chinese Cultural Revolution or the Spanish Inquisition or in the Stalinist USSR, and especially pointed at the current wave of Islamic violence, including in his own land of Nigeria. He paid tribute to the young Kenyan poet Kofi Awoonor who was killed in a terrorist attack on a Nairobi shopping mall. 'Poetry is the antithesis of power, and negation of boundaries, not merely physical boundaries but frontiers of thought and imagination that run contrary to our human avocation. Border crossing is the very condition of true explorers.' He quoted lines by an ancient Japanese poet, by British, American poets, Sylvia Plath and Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer, before widening his references to ask, 'Do you know Tierno Bokar, the Sage of Bandiagara? Do you know the Ozidi Epic? Do you even know the Legend of Shaka Zulu or indeed the narratives of Fagumwa? Do you know of the compendium of Ifa oracular poetry?

"289","[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history   THE KOREA HERALD December 8, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 8, 2017 Friday[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history LENGTH: 1124 wordsIn an age where three-minute book excerpts on mobile phones pass as 'reading,' Hahm Chai-bong, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, has boldly set about writing five volumes on the subject of Korean identity.As he elucidates in the preface to 'Hanguk Saram Mandeulgi,' or 'Becoming Korean,' Hahm's translation of the book's title, the multi-volume work stemmed from a personal quest for self-identity. Having spent much of his formative years abroad, he had been nagged by the question of what his identity as a Korean meant since early on. 'It came as a shock that people of other countries did not know who Koreans were,' writes Hahm. Learning about Korean history and culture and passing on the knowledge to foreigners would be a way to confirm and strengthen his identity as a Korean, Hahm had thought as a student. 'The more professional reason was that as an academic teaching about Korea, political theory or philosophy, or Korean politics at US colleges and Europe, it always fell on me to explain Korea,ï'said Hahm during a recent interview with The Korea Herald at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.'Because of my major (he holds a doctoral degree in political science from Johns Hopkins University), I tried to delve into East Asian political philosophy in an effort to explain why Korea did this and that, the country's economic development and democratization,ï'said Hahm.'What was distinctive about Korea? I tried to answer in various ways. At some point, everything congealed. You can explain it only to a certain extent if you are using a theory. History was the missing component,ï'he said about the very broad scope of the book. The first volume, which came out in late September from the Asan Academy, is an extensive examination of the Joseon period through the 'pro-Chinese isolationist factionï'discourse that deals not only with Joseon itself, but with developments in China and Japan as well. The following volumes will discuss 'becoming Koreanï'through four additional discourses: Pro-Japanese Enlightenment faction, pro-American Christian faction, pro-Soviet Communist faction and ethno-nationalist faction. The second volume is due to be released next week and he is currently writing the third volume.Hahm's ambitious and sweeping quest has great relevance for today's Korea. 'I am trying to explain 'What is juche ideology of North Korea? Where does this incredible sense of siege mentality come from?ï'We see a lot of that in South Korea, too. A lot of anti-foreign sentiment, even though we are very open. There are remnants of nativism, racism which we know are getting stronger as we enter the age of multiculturalism,ï'he said.He finds historical similarities in 'wijeongcheoksaï'faction, or a faction that called for national isolation and exclusion of foreigners, that rose to prominence in the mid-19th century Joseon as the kingdom attempted to adjust to the reality of the fall of Ming China and the rise of Qing China. Although the tributary relations continued between the two countries, the literati of Joseon adopted the concept of 'Little Sinocentrism,ï'arguing that Joseon had succeeded Ming China as the true upholder of neo-Confucianism, the state ideology of Joseon.'Are there parallels here? How are what happened in the mid- to late-19th century affecting our way of thinking?ï'Hahm asked rhetorically.He argues that Joseon's Confucian identity led Koreans to reject their identity when Joseon fell and that this was when Koreans starting for a new identity. Will he be making any controversial claims in the upcoming volumes?'Pro-Japanese faction discourse will be the most controversial. I will be making a new argument on Korea's initial engagement with Japan,ï'he said.'The isolationists are considered the original nationalists while the pro-Japanese faction were extolled for their modernizing effort although they were unsuccessful,ï'he said. 'I start the second volume with the statement that Koreans learned the concept of independence from Japan. From international relations perspective, Japan taught Korea independence because it wanted to breakdown the sino-centric order,ï'said Hahm.In fact, the Independence Gate, erected in 1897 on the spot where a gate greeting Qing envoys once stood with fund raised through a public campaign, symbolizes Joseon's declaration of independence. The 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the first Sino-Japanese War had led to China's recognition of the 'full and complete independence and autonomy of Joseon.'Coming back to Joseon and its lessons for today, Hahm said, 'Ideology should not dominate politics,ï'noting how Joseon scholars and officials had put up a 'valiant defense of Confucianismï'which ultimately stifled Korean society. 'The worst atrocities occur when theories, ideologies, intellectuals dominate,ï'Hahm warned. Asked if his personal question on identity has been resolved through the writing of the book, Hahm said, 'Identity is always on the move. This does not deny the originality and genius of Korean people, however,ï'he said. 'My initial conclusion concerns how these five discourses are manifested in today's society. Korean history shows that when we open up, we prosper. Yet, we think the best way to preserve identity is to close off,ï'he said.'Joseon was successful because it adopted a global standard. Toward the end, Joseon chose isolation which cost it its sovereignty. After independence, North Korea chose isolation,ï'he said. 'At the end of the day, who represents Korea better? The bastardized South Korea,ï'Hahm said. 'We need to understand how cultures, identities change and evolve. The lesson is to open up.ï''Now that I am writing this book, nobody can claim to be more Korean than anyone else,ï'he said. 'I used to be defensive when people said, 'You're Americanized.''While he wrote the book primarily for himself, he also wrote it for young college students, fellow academics and foreigners, with an English-language edition in mind.'On a personal, national level, I wanted to show how difficult it was being a Korean, especially when I was growing up in the West. I can write this because Korean identity is as solid as it can be. I feel incredible pride at the incredible success of Korea. I feel relief for the young generation who do not have to struggle about it,ï'he said.By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POLITICAL SCIENCE (91%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (90%); POLITICS (90%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HISTORY (77%); PHILOSOPHY (77%); RACE & ETHNICITY (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (73%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (73%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (72%); CERTIFICATES  DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (72%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (69%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (64%)ORGANIZATION: INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (84%); JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY (54%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); CHINA (79%); JAPAN (79%); EASTERN ASIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); EUROPE (79%); ASIA (76%)LOAD-DATE: December 11, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

From left are Hyung, Yonsei University professor Sung Tae-yoon, Korean Academic Society of Business Administration Chairman Han In-goo and Chairman Yoo Jang-hee of the National Academy of Sciences' humanities and social science division. / Korea Times photo by Shim Hyun-chulExperts differ on corporate tax hikeBy Nam Hyun-wooYoo Jang-hee, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences' humanities and social science divisionHan In-goo, chairman of the Korean Academic Society of Business AdministrationSung Tae-yoon, Yonsei University professor Hyung Tae-gun, senior adviser of law firm YulchonPeople pin high hopes on newly elected President Moon Jae-in. But experts say his administration faces tall tasks which would decide the fate of Asia's fourth-largest economy amid the fast-changing global environment.Participants of a group discussion organized by The Korea Times picked tax hikes and government spending on job creation as two key topics for the new administration's economic policies. They showed different opinions on the former but univocally warned of negative implications of the latter.Yoo Jang-hee, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences' humanities and social science division, said the country needs to raise corporate taxes. One of Moon's economic pledges is to return the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from the current 22 percent.'Korea's corporate tax rate is lower than other advanced economies and our companies are well aware of the fact. Accordingly, they would not strongly oppose moderate tax hikes,' said Yoo, who also headed the Korea Commission for Corporate Partnership.'The new administration is required to use the increased tax revenues for marginalized people.'Han In-goo, chairman of the Korean Academic Society of Business Administration (KASBA), was against the idea, saying the new leader should consider fair competition separately from corporate competitiveness.'Globally, there is a trend of lowering corporate taxes,' Han said. 'Korea needs to be careful when it comes to issues concerning corporate taxes and regulations when advanced economies such as the United States and France are set to lower taxes and promote a business-friendly environment.'Yonsei University professor Sung Tae-yoon also said the government should try to raise its tax incomes in other areas rather than jacking up the corporate tax rate.'Korea has room to crank up its tax rates on capital gains in consideration of other advanced countries' examples. In particular, corporate capital gains should be taxed in a proper manner,' Sung said.'I'm not saying the government should not raise the corporate tax. What I'm saying is that Korea can raise its tax income by working on capital gains taxes. That should be the priority.'The participants in the discussion questioned the second major key subject of job creation through government spending. Moon promised to create 810,000 jobs in the public sector to tackle Korea's record-high youth employment rate of 9.8 percent last year.Hyung Tae-gun, senior advisor of Yulchon law firm, said the Moon administration's success hinges on how it deals with the country's unemployment issue.'When it comes to his pledges on job creation, I wonder whether Moon's camp looked into the case very carefully and seriously,' said Hyung, formerly a standing commissioner at the Korea Communications Commission.Hyung worried that such an approach would not be very efficient.Sung echoed that the new leader should not spend taxpayers' money on creating public jobs, which he said would not revive the moribund economy. He expects people would reduce their spending because they would expect that the government would raise taxes to fund the hiring expenditures.Yoo also said creating public sector jobs through setting up a supplementary budget would be a stopgap. He stressed that the government needs to focus on improving flexibility in the labor market.Hyung agreed that improving labor market flexibility will be a key to the success of the Moon administration because the new President's pledge of nurturing industries related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution would depend on how flexible the country's labor market is.'Germany is already doing well in smart factories, because the country's labor market is very flexible and Germans worry less about unemployment thanks to the social safety net,' he said. 'Unless the government raises the country's labor market flexibility, Korea would not be able to succeed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era.'Yoo said the new administration should promote the idea of 'Korenter,' a portmanteau of Korea and 'enter' that is a contrary concept to Brexit.'Under the concept, the government should convince the world that Korea wants to cooperate with global partners and is open to joining global economic institutes as long as it is beneficial to both Korea and its trade partners.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (92%); JOB CREATION (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); TAXES & TAXATION (90%); TAX LAW (89%); TAX INCREASES (89%); CAPITAL GAINS TAX (89%); CORPORATE TAX (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); TRENDS (75%); ECONOMIC NEWS (72%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (71%); ECONOMIC POLICY (66%)ORGANIZATION: NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (84%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (93%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); ASIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); FRANCE (70%)LOAD-DATE: May 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

'As a little girl, I had this happy memory of having fun practicing taekwondo. But when I said to my friends that I will learn the sport again two years ago, their initial reaction was why start a children's sport now,' she said. 'I started it again wishing to pull out the happy memories and have the sheer joy that I had many long years ago. Since I began the sport, I feel my body and soul have been strengthened. It is just great that while I focus on practicing basic stances, I can stop thinking about what worried me at my work.'Taekwondo gyms, normally packed with little children, have been offering more evening programs for adults and adult-only taekwondo gyms are beginning to appear as well.'Still local taekwondo gyms have mostly child practitioners. But the new trend now is that they begin to see more adult practitioners. There are many taekwondo gyms across the nation at the moment and thanks to those nostalgic adults, the number of gyms specializing in adult training is on the rise,' said Lee Seung-hwan, grand master of Mooto, a taekwondo gym in Seoul. His gym offers free one day classes so that adults can experience the sport at any time.More grown-ups are picking up color pencils and paint brushes again at neighborhood private academies, or receiving home study materials and tutoring services, initially designed as after school education programs for preschool students through 12th grade.Kim Mi-hyun, a 32-year-old office worker, attends evening art classes near her home. 'Although I liked painting when I was young, I didn't like the idea of going to an art academy or of my paintings being judged and graded,' she said. 'Now, with no pressure at all, I love my time drawing and painting all that I want.'According to data from the education ministry, the number of adults attending arts-related private academies, such as fine arts, music and dance classes, has soared in the past few years. It grew five times to nearly 200,000 in 2016, from only 42,000 in 2013.Experts say those people gain psychological stability by engaging in childhood play and childhood studies. 'Focusing on music and other hobbies they do at the moment, they can go back to their happy childhood memories. Unlike the past where pastimes for children and grown-ups are completely divided, we now see the line having been blurred,' said Shin Kwang-young, a sociology professor at Chung-Ang University. 'The kidult life trend has been spreading to various fields.'An adult member studies Kumon's home-study materials at a cafe in Seoul. They were initially designed as afterschool education programs for preschool and grade school students. / Courtesy of KumonThe number of grownups who receive home-study materials and tutoring services _ the same ones they used to get hesitantly by the suggestion of their academic achievement-minded parents when they were young _ is growing. Kim So-yeon, a 35-year-old mother, has been learning Japanese through Kumon home study material. 'Seeing my daughter learning hangeul through the tutoring service, I thought it would be great to have one for myself.I could learn the language by attending academies, but I like the old way of learning it. Apart from that it is cheaper, receiving the delivered study material each week and studying on my own gives me a special experience, letting me time travel back to 20 years ago,' she said.Kumon, one of the leading afterschool enrichment programs, says its adult members have increased in number 2.7 times over the past four years. It reached over 50,000 as of June this year, from less than 20,000 in 2013.Lee Dong-gwi, a professor at Yonsei University, said 'those in their 30s and 40s belong to the generation who had been forced by their parents to study hard when they were young. As they grew up, they are beginning anew, learning what they really like to study.'The growth rate of Kumon's adult members posted 50.5 percent in 2016, from 17.8 percent in 2015. In the first six months of this year, it showed growth of 23.1 percent.'As a way of self-development, office workers, mainly in the fields of foreign languages such as Japanese or Chinese, use their lunch breaks, commuting times or after-work hours to study,' said a Kumon official.The increased number of adult members is changing Kumon's way of tutoring.'Many adult members just want to receive study materials and skip the tutor's visits to their homes. Others meet their tutors at nearby cafes to check their studies,' said the official. 'For those, it is not just a method to receive high scores and gain certificates. It is rather a self-enrichment program, closer to hobbies.

The information she received there coupled with an interest in K-dramas was enough to make her decide to come to Korea for university.'It still doesn't feel real,' she said. 'Coming here was crazy, one of the biggest things I wished for actually happened.' After completing a yearlong language course and now almost halfway through her first year of economics at Sungkyunkwan University, she is settled into Korea and happy here. However, the adjustment period came with some disappointments. Being Muslim, she was 'heartbrokenï'when she realized how many local dishes contained pork and was initially shocked by the amount of people smoking and how short skirts could be. Also, living in a new culture was hard at first.'When I first came here, that was the first time I left my country and I was just 17, so with people staring at me it was hard. I felt like everyone was looking at me and I walked with my head down and I wouldn't ride the subway alone because I was uncomfortable,ï'she said. However, she soon found her 'first family in Koreaï'in Salam Nuri, a local Muslim group.The group was formed by a community of Muslims -- from Korea and around the world -- who aim share the culture and traditions of Islam with those who are interested. The group was formed in 2012 to reach out to the growing Muslim community here, which now stands at an estimated 140,000. The organization holds fundraising events as well as seminars, workshops and Arabic classes that are all open to the public. On top of university and a part-time job, Hussaina volunteers as a media manager with the group. She was introduced to the organization by Safa Lamia Ahmed, a physics students at Ewha Womans University from Bangladesh. For Safa, the organization serves as a home away from home. ã€€'Outside of school I wouldn't really say I have really close friends at university. My closest friends in Korea are from Salam Nuri or from my first year (here) during the language classes,ï'she said.ã€€Safa's life in Seoul is a far cry from her time in Asan, where she studied Korean after she arrived in 2013. In an area that doesn't have a big foreign population, her appearance was often met with shock. With daily stares and questions about her hijab, she replied with a smile and used the opportunity to practice her language skills and soon found that the local community warmed to her. 'I think Korean people don't have much knowledge about Muslims. The thing you don't have knowledge about, you're scared of, right?ï'she said.Before finding out about Salam Nuri -- a combination of the Arabic word 'Salamï'and Korean word 'Nuriï'for 'peaceful worldï'-- Safa had no Muslim community, something she really missed. 'Here in Salam Nuri we are all from different countries and everything could be different, but somehow we all understand each other really well,ï'she said. 'It just feels very home-like.'The 24-year-old, who is also a volunteer with the organization, sees her role in the group as an opportunity to wipe out the prejudice Muslims in Korea face, which she says usually focuses on terrorism -- an association that has cost her jobs.After being called for an interview as an English teacher she was asked to send a photograph by the recruiter. 'I sent it and he said 'OK wait.ï'Before coming to the interview he called me and asked if I could remove my hijab.ï'When she declined, she was told not to come to the interview. The recruiter apologized, saying that 'people would be scared,ï'although she is not sure if the issues was with the recruiter or the client.ã€€'I wasn't really surprised but it felt bad that it wasn't because I didn't have the ability to teach, it was because of my hijab,ï'she said. After this incident Safa stopped applying for jobs. She currently works at a Korean Halal restaurant owned by one of the leaders of Salam Nuri near the mosque in Itaewon. Hussaina, who works at the same restaurant, said she didn't apply for any jobs because it's harder to get work outside the university if you wear a hijab.ã€€While a university might be more diverse in its hiring practices, having a convenient place to pray on campus can be a struggle for some. After clearing it with a professor overseeing international students at her university, Safa said she was given the green light to use the chapel and an adjacent multipurpose room located in a science building -- where she spends most of her day -- to pray. However, she said she arrived one day to find 'Muslims no trespassingï'written on the whiteboard. While the sign was later erased, she said she feels unwelcome and usually uses what empty space she can find instead.ã€€Ewha Womans University pointed out that, although it is a Christian school and a lot of the prayer rooms are for Christians, it does provide Multicultural Meditation Rooms in two student dormitories -- on opposite sides of the campus -- which Muslims are welcome to use for prayer. The university also stated they have not received any complaints or any expressions of discontent from Muslims at Ewha or from any other religious or nonreligious groups regarding prayer rooms or lack thereof.ã€€While Safa says any bad experiences she has had here are exceptions rather than the rule, she hopes Koreans will become more open to learning about her religion beyond what is shown in the media. ã€€With the government announced earlier this year plans to expand the number of Muslim-friendly restaurants and Lotte has opened a designated prayer room for Muslims in its Jamsil store, one could conclude that Korea is showing strides towards change -- even if it is for tourism purposes. However, Korea's representation of Muslims has recently come under fire.

'This is their society, we can always go back to our country but they only have Korea.

The main question was: Are SDGs related to SSE?'Yes, they are. They are closely linked,' said Kim Eui-young, a professor of political science at Seoul National University and one of the presenters at the academy. 'SSE speaks to a number of core elements of the SDGs' transformative agenda, especially their focus on integrated approaches, solidarity, participation, inclusiveness, mixed economy and deep transformation in production and consumption patterns.'Artemy Izmestiev from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Seoul Policy Centre said the UNDP's Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) is a case in point. The PAGE project operates worldwide, assisting developing countries through making green investments and launching green initiatives.Denison Jayasooria, a member of the Intercontinental Network for the Promotion of Social Solidarity Economy Asia from Malaysia, offered a successful example.He explained how a village community in northern Borneo, ravaged by a dispute over land ownership, successfully managed economic development through eco-tourism and to nature conservation.Almost 150 social entrepreneurs, activists and scholars from Korea and other countries signed up for the week-long academy.On Wednesday, participants discussed a wide range of related topics with their colleagues and panels in small groups. The academy was organized by the Global Social Economy Forum Secretariat and the International Labour Organization.Under the leadership of Mayor Park Won-soon, the Seoul Metropolitan Government launched the Global Social Economy Forum in 2014.The city's support for the social economy began with Mayor Park who was sworn in as mayor in 2011.Currently, the city government supports more than 3,500 social enterprises with aims to improve public health, welfare and urban housing.In a recent interview with The Korea Times, the mayor said he was a social entrepreneur himself and expressed his strong support for the SSE.He founded Beautiful Store, a secondhand shop, and imported coffee beans directly from farmers in Asia.'The social economy is a solution to inequality, which erupted during last year's candlelit protests. To be hopeful, we need a path that's good for the community and their survival, not for immediate returns for only a few people,' Park said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: UNITED NATIONS (92%); SUSTAINABILITY (92%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (90%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (88%); MAYORS (87%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (87%); CITIES (85%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); CONSERVATION (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); ECOTOURISM (73%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (73%); CONSUMPTION (72%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (69%); USED MERCHANDISE STORES (64%); INTERVIEWS (60%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); ASIA (92%); BORNEO (79%); MALAYSIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 29, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

A new approach is needed that moves beyond the outdated Cold War framework and engages the Korean people and their neighbors in shaping their own destiny,' GPF Chairman Moon Hyun-jin said during an opening speech, Monday.Moon, an NGO leader who has spent a decade in the unification campaign, underlined the need to find shared values or moral justification among global citizens for such a goal.He presented the ancient Korean mantra 'hongik ingan' that is devoted to the welfare of mankind, as a vision for civic society in working toward unification, drawing much support from the participants.'Any global perspective or approach based solely on political or economic considerations is inherently limited and insufficient,' Moon said. 'What is required is a simple, clear vision that encapsulates the essence of our common humanity.'Showing support for Moon's claim, Heritage Foundation founder Edwin Feulner encouraged civic activists to reaffirm their commitment to the goal of unification.'When we can see opportunities for one step, there are things we share together. These are the kind of things that can slowly bring us along on the road toward eventual reunification,' Feulner said. 'I recommend all of you realize this important work and pay constant and repeated attention.'A forum to discuss the role of stakeholders of the Korean Peninsula was also held as a sideline among scholars from South Korea, U.S., China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia, Wednesday.They urged practical action from their governments in one voice, with some directing their criticism toward the inaction of China, the biggest ally to North Korea.Joseph Bosco, senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), called on Washington to pressure Beijing to engage in resolving North Korea's nuclear threats.'It should lead imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese commercial and governmental entities that assist the North's nuclear and missile programs,' he said.Suggesting the strategic communications program should be directed at China itself, he claimed, 'That way, the self-respecting Chinese population will know their leaders are keeping in power the most dangerous regime in the world.'Noting this year is the critical transitional period for the Korean Peninsula, Feulner, a top advisor to the U.S. Trump administration, assured a strong Korea-U.S. alliance will remain despite growing geopolitical uncertainties.'The fact that Secretary of Defense Mattis, the first person confirmed by the United of States Senate as a member of Trump's Cabinet, made his first trip to Asia and made the first stop to Seoul, Korea, that I think points out everyone in the new administration continues to bear in terms of the bilateral relationship and in terms of the whole evolving structure of relationship in East Asia,' he said in the following session.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS (90%); HOTELS & MOTELS (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); COLD WAR (78%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); COMMUNITY ACTIVISM (76%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (74%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (68%)ORGANIZATION: THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION (57%)CITY: BEIJING, CHINA (69%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); PHILIPPINES (93%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (93%); INDIA (92%); CHINA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: March 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Bert the Turtle. ??Bert is a very, very careful fellow,?? the announcer says, as Bert suddenly vanishes inside his shell. All you can see are his eyes peering out.??When there??s danger, this is the way he keeps from being hurt,?? the announcer explains. ??Sometimes it even saves his life. ... We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous. Since it may be used against us, we must get ready for it, just as we must get ready for the many other dangers that are around us all the time.??Next, we see real, live children who are just like us. When a warning siren sounds -- or when there is just a terrifying light flash -- the kids know how to duck under their desks and cover the back of their necks with clasped hands, fully aware window glass will be flying when an atomic bomb explodes.This 1951 movie, a federal Civil Defense Administration production, was created in a studio in New York City??s Astoria, Queens -- just a few miles from where young Donald Trump was in kindergarten. Local New York kids all saw the movie??s searing, unforgettable lesson; eventually, most kids coast-to-coast saw it too.On Tuesday, one of those kids, now 71, sat in Bedminster, New Jersey, in the comfort of one of his golf course clubhouses and, repeatedly glancing down at words on a paper, sounded a warning heard ??round the world.????North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.?? Glancing down again, he repeated his flammable soundbite to assure the message was received by North Korea??s irrational leader, Kim Jong-un, whose regime is reportedly capable of making missile-ready miniaturized nuclear weapons. ??And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.??In the hours that followed, many in the news media began comparing Trump??s ??fire and fury?? threat with what President Harry Truman said in 1945 after Japan refused to surrender after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Truman warned the Japanese that if they didn??t surrender, ??they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.??But the comparison doesn??t work -- because Truman was warning the enemy that had attacked America, started the war and been defeated. Also: Defense Secretary James ??Mad Dog?? Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, has long warned that America cannot launch a pre-emptive military attack capable of preventing North Korea from inflicting horrendous slaughter in South Korea.As bad as all that was, it got predictably worse: North Korea??s leader vowed to attack Guam, where US military is based.And then came this: Trump officials acknowledged Wednesday that the president had issued his ultimatum without clearing his incendiary words with his team of generals. Trump just dredged up his ??fire and fury?? words from some very dark place deep inside. For years, Trump has openly (see also: cluelessly) wondered why America bothers to have nuclear weapons if it isn??t willing to use them.The result is that Trump recklessly forced an already horrendous confrontation to a potentially even more calamitous level, one that could cause massive tragedy for both North Koreans and America??s trusting allies in Seoul. Wednesday afternoon, Mattis, ever the loyal serviceman, protected his boss??s backside by warning Pyongyang to halt its pursuit of a nuclear bomb and not launch any military action ??that would lead to the end of its regime and destruction of its people.??So now the world waits: Before this all ends, the question of whether or not a massive human tragedy occurs on the Korean Peninsula may be decided by the one world figure who never wanted this starring role. China??s President Xi Jinping may find the diplo-guts and actual humanity to save Kim and Trump from their excessive selves.Xi may finally insist that North Korea??s only chance for a successful future will begin with China??s help, and a world of guarantees -- but only if the North ends its militaristic ways now.There is only one way that can occur: The world??s two most implausible co-protagonists, North Korea??s Kim and America??s Trump, must (for once!) stifle their nuclear-bombastic urges, duck out of the global spotlight, cover their gilded assets -- and give peace a chance.By Martin Schram Martin Schram, an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service, is a veteran Washington journalist, author and TV documentary executive. -- Ed.(Tribune Content Agency)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CHILDREN (90%); MILITARY WEAPONS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); BOMBS & EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (90%); BOMBINGS (89%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (89%); WORLD WAR II (78%); CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT (78%); COLD WAR (78%); CARTOONS & COMICS (71%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (69%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (65%); US PRESIDENTS (62%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (60%)PERSON: JAMES MATTIS (74%); DONALD TRUMP (68%); KIM JONG UN (50%)CITY: NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (91%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (91%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: August 14, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Ahn is one of the top pansori singers, or sorikkun, of her generation, listed as Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 23 for ""gayageum sanjo and byeongchang"" (singing while playing the 12-stringed zither). She has also worked for various organizations related to traditional Korean music such as the National Changgeuk Company of Korea (NCCK), the National Gugak Center and the Jeonju International Sori Festival. For the New Year's Eve concert, Ahn will perform ""Heungbo-ga,"" one of the five surviving pansori plays. The performance is part of the NTOK's regular ongoing ""Complete Performance of Pansori"" series. The series has been running over 30 years since 1984 and provides a rare opportunity to appreciate the five remaining pansori works in full. The longest, 'Chunhyangga,' takes up to eight or nine hours.Ahn has performed 27 times for the series, covering all five plays - 'Heungboga,' 'Chunhyangga,' 'Simcheongga,' 'Sugungga' and 'Jeokbyeokga.' Ahn said, ""The five remaining pansori plays can vie with the Four Comedies by Shakespeare.""She will sing ""Heungboga"" in the style of her teacher Kim So-hee (1917-1995), alongside her colleagues who also learned from Kim, including NCCK members Yoo Soo-jung and Kim Cha-kyong.""Heungboga,"" revolves around a poor but kind man Heungbu and his greedy older brother Nolbu. The piece is known for its encouraging-good-and-punishing-evil plot and folksy jokes. Kim So-hee's version added a touch of grace to the original pansori.For the second act, Ahn will sing folk songs from southern Gyeonggi Province known as ""yukjabaegi."" It is a brisk and lively folk tune with six words to the line and considered representative of folk songs of the Gyeonggi region.Kim Kee-hyung, a Korean language and literature professor of Korea University, will be the emcee and commentator of the concert.After the night concert, audiences can celebrate the New Year with a countdown and fireworks at the outdoor plaza of the theater against the backdrop of Mt.

'Facts' this year got put in quotation marks.ã€€All the other political difficulties of the Donald Trump era are subsumed in this one. If we aren't sure what's true, how can we act to make things better? If we don't know where we are on the map, how do we know which way to move? Democracy assumes a well-informed citizenry that argues about solutions -- not about facts.ã€€We can all choose our favorite examples of America's increasing difficulty in agreeing about evidence: the disdain for science among climate-change skeptics; the refusal to believe allegations about people we like, and the overeagerness to denounce those we don't like; the way in which political polarization has spread into every area of our common life -- including sports.ã€€What should thoughtful people do about this overarching problem? Part of the answer lies with my profession, the news business. We need to work harder to make sure that we're unbiased truth-tellers, not a series of echo chambers. When every story in a newspaper or on a website or cable channel seems to be going in the same direction, that's a sign that something's wrong. That's one reason I'd like to see a return of ombudsmen, to hold news organizations more accountable.ã€€But journalists need new tools. We can't always vet every fact. We rely on certain trusted sources, news services such as the Associated Press or Reuters. But even those superbly professional fact-gatherers sometimes have trouble verifying information. Social media can help -- people can upload video from their cellphones of events as they happen. But we're learning that social media can be tools of deception as well as truth.ã€€So here's an offbeat proposal: Just as the provenance of a work of art is established by art historians and auction houses, we need technological tools that will help confirm the provenance of facts.ã€€The idea is simple: An art buyer should want to know that the painting attributed to, say, Leonardo da Vinci was actually created by him. So specialists seek to reconstruct the chain of ownership, documenting how a work passed among collectors and galleries over the centuries. Scholars can't always establish direct links back to the artist (and such uncertainty appears to cloud the recent purchase of Leonardo's 'Salvator Mundiï'for $450 million). But the exercise is essential for the proper functioning of art markets.ã€€There's even a new approach known as 'digital provenance.ï'This topic was explored at a conference this month at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. One set of panels explored 'visualizing object histories,ï'including the study of 'movements of objects and people through time and space.'ã€€The internet giants like Google and Facebook should be tuning their systems to establish the provenance of fact. I'd like to see them using 'machine learningï'to interrogate supposed facts to establish where they've been -- how they first surfaced, and how they were passed from user to user. If there are gaps in provenance -- an unexplained missing link in the chain of evidence, or signs of misattribution -- then those anomalies should be flagged automatically.ã€€In this fact-provenance scheme, we'd hopefully be able to trace information back to the source and detect evidence of manipulation. News organizations whose track record is shown to be reliable would get weighted positively by the digital system. Such measurement of source reliability would be a tricky test, but it doesn't strike me as impossible. Google does something similar every time you type a phrase into the search box.People could still base their decisions on dubious, unverified facts, just as a collector can still buy a painting whose provenance is suspect. But there would at least be fair warning.We speak often of the 'marketplace of ideas,ï'in the expectation that markets operate rationally and efficiently. But consumers assume that most markets aren't rigged, and that tainted or unsafe products have been screened. That's obviously a complicated problem when the commodity is information -- the First Amendment lets us promote ideas without rating their safety. But the First Amendment doesn't protect fraud, libel or deceit.ã€€We live in an information ecosystem, to choose another analogy. If it becomes polluted, all the creatures that depend on that ecosystem are at risk. We say that sunlight is the best disinfectant. But that's true only when the sun shines brightly.By David Ignatius David Ignatius can be reached via Twitter: @IgnatiusPost.-- Ed.(Washington Post Writers Group)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); NEWS REPORTING (86%); HISTORY (76%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%); DEMOCRACIES (72%); PAINTING (70%); SOCIAL MEDIA (69%); WRITERS (69%); AUCTIONS (64%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (64%); ART HISTORY (64%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (50%)COMPANY: ASSOCIATED PRESS (53%)INDUSTRY: SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES (53%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (56%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: November 26, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"300","Foul-mouth - a common trait of strong leaders?",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"May","Foul-mouth - a common trait of strong leaders?  Korea Times May 4, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesMay 4, 2017 ThursdayFoul-mouth - a common trait of strong leaders?BYLINE: By Kang Hyun-kyungLENGTH: 1165 wordsCandidates play 'tough leader' cardInflammatory language, insults and even swear words are rampant in campaign rallies as the May 9 election approaches.Presidential hopefuls and their aides appear to feel little pressure when using such emotional language as they play 'the tough leader card' as a last-minute tactic to rally support from undecided voters who are reserving their decision in search of a strong leader.If frontrunner Moon Jae-in is elected, liberal politician Lee Hae-chan, a chief strategist for Moon, warned the nation's conservatives will be annihilated.Liberty Korea Party (LKP) candidate Hong Joon-pyo said Lee's remarks terrified him because they reminded him of the massacre the Khmer Rouge led in Cambodia in the 1970s. Hong called some progressive activists who insulted him 'sons of bitches.'The outspoken politician depicted Sohn Hak-kyu, the chief campaign strategist of People's Party candidate Ahn Cheol-soo, as 'a political refugee' for his flip-flopping in his political orientation. His remarks followed Sohn's speech during a campaign rally in April that 'a vote for Hong is a vote for Moon.' Sohn was a longtime member of the now defunct Saenuri Party and served as governor of Gyeonggi Province between 2002 and 2006 after winning an election on the conservative party's ticket. He defected to the now liberal Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) during the 2007 presidential election, years before his affiliation with the centrist People's Party.In times of crisis and unprecedented political upheaval, fiery politicians appeal more easily than calm leaders to the hearts and minds of voters. This sentiment seems to play out behind the presidential race where curses, insults and unedited language are in full swing.Kwak Dae-kyung, a sociology professor at Dongguk University, said presidential candidates seem to view emotional language as part of their campaign strategy to highlight they are strong leaders. 'They use such language to deliver their decisiveness and toughness,' the sociologist said. 'I'm not sure whether the campaign tactic is working among voters or not, though.'Ohio State University researchers, meanwhile, put forth insightful analysis about emotional language.In times of economic stability, they found voters trust restrained candidates. But in times of crisis or uncertainty, they view a candidate who uses high-intensity and emotional language as a more suitable one to lead the nation, according to a study published in the September 2016 issue of Presidential Studies Quarterly.Presidential candidates traded barbs and heated language during the last televised debate on Tuesday, a week before the election.Hong cited Moon's adviser Lee's sensational remarks to discredit the frontrunner. 'According to your adviser, all conservatives will be burnt at the stake if you are elected,' the conservative politician said. 'This means I will face that tragic fate if you're elected. Could you please confirm if my understanding is correct?'Hong alleged that Moon's plan to 'purge the corrupt, outdated forces' is a plot to retaliate against his opponents, as opposed to what Moon called a plan to unify the nation.Moon dismissed this and claimed Lee was quoted out of context.He too is not immune from criticism that he went too far.In a speech to a campaign rally, April 30, the DPK candidate alleged that his opponents tried to paint him as a communist.'You jerks must bear this in mind: the voters won't be duped again,' Moon said before his cheering supporters in the South Chungcheong Province city of Gongju.Moon, who served as presidential chief of staff during the Roh Moo-hyun government, is accused of having directed the officials in charge of the South-North Korea channel to consult with the North Korean regime about the U.N. General Assembly's Resolution 62/167 decrying the dismal human rights conditions in the North before South Korea made a decision on it.The allegation was raised in former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon's memoir, titled 'Glaciers Are Moving,' which was published last October. Moon's alleged role behind the Roh government's abstention from the U.N. resolution 'to curry favor with the North'has since emerged as a campaign issue.Moon denied this and claimed he was quoted out of context in the former foreign minister's memoir.The outspoken Hong, whose tactics have been compared to Trump-style campaigning, has used plenty of unedited words during the campaign rallies. The LKP presidential candidate labeled 20 progressive activists, who sprayed salt toward him as 'sons of bitches.'Spraying salt is an old ritual Koreans do to insult people who disgust them or they feel bring bad luck. Hong faced it on April 10, a day after his belated resignation as governor of South Gyeongsang Province paved the way for his vice governor Ryu Soon-hyun to succeed to the post as acting governor without holding a by-election to elect Hong's replacement.The current law stipulates the legal deadline for sitting governors and mayors to send their official resignation letters to the National Election Commission : if their resignation comes after the deadline, those who are in the no. 2 post automatically fill the vacant leadership, without a by-election.'I had suffered a lot all during my tenure as governor of South Gyeongsang Province because of the leftists,' he said during a campaign rally on April 29 in the southeastern city of Gimhae. 'I returned to my hometown to serve as governor but those sons of bitches tried to get me in trouble so I struggled a lot.'Linguist Choi Jong-hee, the author of 'Park Geun-hye's Language' (2016), said campaign staffers' misleading advice or candidates' personal traits are the main drivers behind politicians becoming foul-mouthed. 'Some campaign strategists believe candidates are viewed as tough leaders if they use emotional language, which is untrue,' he said. 'Moon, for example, is not viewed as a strong leader, partly because of his speaking style. He is not eloquent. He is closer to an academic. So my guess is one of his campaign advisers has advised him to use tough language to overcome his relatively soft image.'Choi, president of the Language and Thinking Institute, said there is no direct relationship between strong leaders and emotional language and so campaign tactics focused on emotional language would do little for candidates in the presidential race.The linguist said Hong's tough talk seems to be associated with his personal characteristics.

But after a court turned down the special prosecutors' request for an arrest warrant for Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, it is likely that the nation's top conglomerate will rather choose to list Samsung Bioepis on U.S. bourse instead of dividing Samsung Electronics and listing it on the NASDAQ.'Elliot has demanded Samsung be more transparent,' a source from Samsung said. 'But it will be difficult to list Samsung Electronics on the NASDAQ by dividing it. Instead, Samsung Bioepis seems to be fit for this in terms of business scale.'Elliot Management has continued to urge Samsung to divide its electronics business into a business body and a holding entity and list the former on the NASDAQ to boost transparency in business management.Samsung Group has responded that it will list Bioepis instead, aiming at boosting its affiliate's global presence and its financing capabilities for research and development. As one of Bioepis's major shareholders, Samsung Electronics would be also indirectly subject to the strict obligations of the NASDAQ, which would help raise its transparency.The group had previously planned to list Bioepis on the NASDAQ and its largest shareholder, Samsung BioLogics, on the domestic stock market last year. But unlike BioLogics, which successfully debuted on the Seoul bourse, the initial public offering (IPO) of Bioepis has been postponed amid a downturn of the U.S. stock market.Samsung Electronics has tighter control over its biotechnology affiliates as the group's de-facto holding company Samsung C&T holds a 43.4 percent share in Samsung BioLogics, which is the biggest shareholder of Samsung Bioepis.To fund its subsidiary, Samsung BioLogics has said it will participate in a 200 billion won capital increase in June, based on the money it drew through its public offering last year.The group will also need to persuade Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos about the NASDAQ listing because he is the No. 2 shareholder of Samsung Bioepis.'The new CEO of Biogen, who is the second-largest shareholder of Bioepis, is familiar with internal matters of the company business, he is a registered director of Bioepis,' the source said. 'He can play a role to explain to the board of directors of Biogen about the listing of Bioepis on the NASDAQ.'As of October last year, Biogen holds an 8.8 percent share of Samsung Bioepis. But the U.S. biotechnology company can increase its stake up to 'one less share from 50 percent' by the end of 2018. With this backdrop, Samsung will need to make the decision on the NASDAQ listing this year or at least within the first half of next year.Meanwhile, Samsung Bioepis remained cautious about the listing plan.'We do not plan to list in the near future, and will continue to monitor market conditions to determine the optimal timing for our initial public offering,' a Samsung Bioepis spokesman said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (90%); STOCK OFFERINGS (89%); INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (89%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); HOLDING COMPANIES (89%); SHAREHOLDERS (89%); STOCK EXCHANGES (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (78%); SCANDALS (78%); IMPEACHMENT (78%); POLITICS (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (77%); ARRESTS (77%); BRIBERY (77%); ELECTRONICS (77%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (76%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (73%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (73%); ARREST WARRANTS (72%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (72%); PUBLIC PROSECUTORS (72%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD (91%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (52%)TICKER: SMSN (LSE) (91%); 005930 (KSE) (91%); BIIB (NASDAQ) (52%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS334310 AUDIO & VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (91%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (91%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (91%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (52%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (52%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (52%)PERSON: LEE JAE-YONG (92%); PARK GEUN-HYE (90%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (92%)LOAD-DATE: January 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

This represents 500 additional 'new jobs,' or an annual 50 percent increase compared with the preceding years.The company said that its hiring plan is aimed at providing quality jobs and securing talent for the forthcoming Fourth Industrial Revolution. This strikes a unique path of fighting overseas protectionism and dealing with automation, which many firms feel tempted to use as excuses for outsourcing and restructuring that entails reducing payrolls. In addition, it also shows POSCO is ready to act as a more responsible corporate citizen by doing something to address one of the great challenges our society faces _ the reduction of decent jobs.Also, the company plans to apply a 'blind hiring' method _ for example there will be no discrimination by majors the aspirants studied in college. This is for two reasons _ first hiring the best pool of talent, and second easing the difficulties facing graduates with diplomas in the social sciences and humanities.But the appealing part in the POSCO hiring plan is for it to lighten the work load for its employees, helping them attain a work and life balance. Koreans are one of the longest working peoples with their work and life out of balance. This is due to the fact that despite the marked improvement in the nation's economy, corporate culture is still stuck in the development era _ dictating individual sacrifice for that of the group.This can't be sustainable. Already, many side effects such as a low birthrate and uneven income distribution are suffocating the vibrancy that the economy needs. True, there is speculation that it was a 'political' act by POSCO Chairman Kwon Oh-joon to curry favor with President Moon Jae-in. Critics may argue that this boosted hiring may not be good for shareholders.No matter. Big firms have hired far fewer people than what is called for by profits they make from society. They shouldn't wait too long to follow the POSCO example.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: RECRUITMENT & HIRING (90%); IRON & STEEL MILLS (90%); CORPORATE CULTURE (89%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (77%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (77%); BUSINESS ETHICS & CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); BIRTHS & BIRTH RATES (71%)COMPANY: POSCO (90%)TICKER: PKX (NYSE) (90%); PIDD (LSE) (90%); 5412 (TSE) (90%); 005490 (KSE) (90%)INDUSTRY: NAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWING (90%); NAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURING (90%); NAICS331110 IRON & STEEL MILLS & FERROALLOY MANUFACTURING (90%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (53%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: August 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

And that's going to be my responsibility. But I'll tell you, that responsibility could have been made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.""Magazines featuring front pages of US President Donald Trump (left) and China's President XI Jinping are displayed at a news stand in Beijing on Thursday. (Yonhap)Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on China over North Korea's nuclear and missile threats ahead of his first summit with Xi, which is scheduled to begin Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.With North Korea topping the agenda, their two-day gathering is to pose an early test of the two countries' diplomacy. The two leaders will also face off over China's escalating economic retaliation against South Korea over the ongoing deployment of the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile assets here, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, trade and other bilateral, regional and global issues.Pyongyang has in recent months been carrying out a series of missile and engine tests, with satellite imagery pointing to signs of a fresh underground detonation. In the latest provocation, it fired a ballistic missile into the East Sea on Wednesday, though it appears to have failed.While carrying out a North Korea policy review, Washington has displayed its willingness to sanction more Chinese companies dealing with North Korea, and raised the possibility for military action as one of its options.Trump has indicated he will use trade as leverage to press Beijing to play a greater role in containing the Kim Jong-un regime's nuclear and missile program. He also called North Korea a ""humanity problem"" Tuesday, and warned that the US is ready to tackle it on its own if China does not help, in an interview released Sunday.In a phone call later in the day with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump also said that ""all options are on the table"" and called the North's newest missile launch a ""dangerous provocation and grave security threat,"" Abe told reporters.Matt Pottinger, senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, called the secondary sanctions a ""very much live"" question for the summit, saying China has the ability to squeeze the North ""in a way that no other single country can.""""We'd like to see China working closely with the US to address the menace emanating from North Korea, their weapons programs, the provocations that we've seen every week, missile launches, including one that we had not too many hours ago,"" he said at a separate news conference Wednesday for foreign press.""I think that North Korea long ago ceased to be a strategic asset for China. It is now quite clearly a strategic liability and it is one that is having an impact on the region. It is one that has the potential to destabilize not only the peninsula, but really the region as well.""Seoul's National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin (Yonhap)Seoul, for its part, has been intensifying diplomatic efforts to raise its voice on North Korea and China's THAAD retaliation.Seoul's National Security Office chief Kim Kwan-jin and US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster held a phone conversation early Thursday, condemning Pyongyang's ongoing missile liftoffs and reaffirming the THAAD stationing plan, Cheong Wa Dae said.Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here, also had separate phone calls with the top nuclear negotiators of the US and Japan -- Joseph Yun and Kenji Kanasugi -- to review the newest missile test and coordinate responses to Pyongyang's additional provocations, the ministry said.Following the Trump-Xi meetings, Washington would seek a top-level consultation to brief Seoul on its results and facilitate joint next steps, a ministry official told reporters on the customary condition of anonymity.""We expect the forthcoming US-China summit will provide a critical chance in the international community's efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue,"" ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck said at a regular news briefing, noting Pottinger's portrayal of Pyongyang as Beijing's strategic liability.""South Korea and the US share a solid view that China's role is more important than anything else in leading North Korea to the path of denuclearization.""By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (90%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (89%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (78%); MISSILE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (76%); PRESS CONFERENCES (72%)PERSON: XI JINPING (93%); DONALD TRUMP (92%); ABDULLAH II, KING OF JORDAN (73%); SHINZO ABE (60%); KIM JONG UN (58%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); BEIJING, CHINA (73%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (91%); SOUTH CHINA SEA (79%); FLORIDA, USA (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (69%)COUNTRY: CHINA (98%); UNITED STATES (95%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); JORDAN (88%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); JAPAN (79%); ASIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: April 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"304","[Lee Joo-hee] The perils of playing nice",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"February","[Lee Joo-hee] The perils of playing nice   THE KOREA HERALD February 1, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDFebruary 1, 2017 Wednesday[Lee Joo-hee] The perils of playing nice LENGTH: 660 wordsWe grew up being taught to play nice.ã€€In most folk stories we were told as children, helpless, innocent but conscientious beings eventually won over the evil, who were unfair, greedy and conniving.ã€€But as we grew older, we gradually learned that nice guys tend to finish last. More or less, playing by the rules often left us defeated, cheated or behind.ã€€As we step into the ""real world,"" we grow to learn that being nice can actually get us nowhere.ã€€It seems more so these days that the world is surrounded and led by those that, based on our juvenile standards, would be closer to wolves than lambs.ã€€A divisive businessman -- touting authoritarian populism that goes against the humanity, liberal democracy and global capitalism that modern societies have considered sacred values -- has been elected to a seat that can move and shake the entire world order.ã€€A relentless politician -- bracing to challenge constitutionalism while tuning out historical truths of imperialistic atrocities -- is on course to become his country's longest-serving postwar premier.ã€€At home, a ham-fisted affair of plutocracy between political and economic leaders has thrown the country into months of lethargy, with their prerogatives still defended by many for having led profit and growth.ã€€What indeed appears to be fundamentally futile is the fact that all of this is being done under the umbrella of democracy, a value that has been pulling the world along for decades and disciplining those who dare sidestep moral norms.ã€€Having pursued the noble values that held us grounded at times we were personally tested, we are indeed seen to be entering a time of doubt, questioning whether what we have believed to be the utmost truth since our childhood warrants any further devotion.ã€€There is also this nagging voice inside that makes us hesitate to define our own as being truly altruistic, whether we are innocent enough to throw unbridled criticisms, and whether we are truly free of guilt in our meager ordinary lives.ã€€The sentiment was well illustrated by Al Gini, professor of business ethics at Loyola University in Chicago, who said in his previous book that the most glaring example of academic oxymoron are the terms ""business ethics"" and ""moral leadership.""ã€€As businesses operate under the ""dictum of legal moralism,"" he wrote that everything is allowed that is not strictly forbidden.ã€€He went on to explain, citing surveys, that workers are as ethical and dutiful in doing their jobs as their bosses and companies are perceived to be ethical.ã€€But a business, although it reaps profit through products, is inevitably a people's business, reliant on relations, as it cannot be an isolated entity that is unaffected by the demands of individuals and society, he added.ã€€These pretty much sum up the task we have at hand, as we are placed in a dilemma between tackling ethical lapses and the sense of survival to continue on with our economic fulfillment.ã€€But it is because of that, that we must turn to the last bastion of restraint as we wade through the time of extremes.ã€€Although democracy and capitalism seem to pale in the face of declining egalitarian prosperity, it is the best we have.ã€€The rule of law has provided the yardsticks for democratic capitalism, and legality must remain unwavering from self-interest or even public sentiment.ã€€Legal interpretation and application should be tight, equal and powerful, and in order to achieve that, it should be respected and upheld at all times.ã€€It is also because of this, that we demand those in any type of power to operate under the potency of virtues, for without followers they would have nothing to lead.ã€€It is not just to play nice, but to avoid co-destruction, at the least for sake of our next generation growing up to the same folk tales of the good disarming the evil.By Lee Joo-heeLee Joo-hee is the business desk editor of The Korea Herald.

"305","On Forty Steps",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"July","On Forty Steps  Korea Times July 18, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesJuly 18, 2017 TuesdayOn Forty StepsBYLINE: By Bernard RowanLENGTH: 701 wordsBusan may be South Korea's second city, but it includes a monument central to the history of present-day Korea. I'm talking about the Forty Steps Stairway in Jungang neighborhood. Don't overlook this deceptively simple space and place. I think it's a symbol of the past and the way forward for Korea. That means a future of peace and eventual reunification.During the Korean War, the new Republic struggled. The Chinese Army and the North pushed the U.S.-ROK forces all the way to Busan. Many Korean people in the South lived around the Forty Steps area, originally a Japanese residential area. Lives were at risk. The War divided families. In the tumult, loved ones lost one another.In turn, the stairs stood as a finding place. People knew to go there and look for loved ones. In the area grew a marketplace for Koreans to buy and sell goods. Nearby humble homes cropped up -- a grim place at a grim time. Yet, the stairs were a place of hope.The Forty Steps enabled reunifying Korean families who had lost one another. It also stands today as a monument to those horrible times of war, suffering, injury, death, and dislocation. A deep basis for han, the steps also bridge to a possible happiness and peace.Today the steps form one site in a cultural district created by the municipal authority in the 1990s. Simple, rugged sculptures depict various characters and scenes of life then. Enjoy the many works of art, restaurants and shops in the area. Also stop to climb or descend the steps. A sculpture of a man playing an accordion rests midway. From the Life in Korea webpage, I've read the song 'Gyeongsang-do Lady' plays nearby.At the top of the steps is a memorial display in the Donggwang Dong office building. Next time I visit, I want to see the Forty Steps Memorial Hall located there.What's this mediating accordionist? His music waits in time, awaiting the rebirth of a Korean peninsula at peace. No more armistice. No more weapons of mass destruction. No more separation of North and South. No more power rivalries and constellations of allies and competitors? Will his real brother ever find the steps to reunite with this statue and bring it to life?The song, Arirang, also came to mind when I visited this place. Someone should write a version that focuses on Forty Steps Stairway. Like the lyrics of this perhaps most famous Korean folk song, the steps represent a passage. They mark a way from past to future among people who love one another, a dream or myth or hope for two beloveds to unite again in future. The Forty Steps meant a place for loved ones to meet again for many people. They still mean that for Korean leaders and families divided North and South, and for the divided countries themselves. I'm going to tell you that a cousin to this song is the famous hymn, 'Shall We Gather at The River'.One day the leaders of a unified Korea will meet in this place, I hope. I hope they'll call for erecting another district, cultural symbols, and museum to the fruition of this place's solemn yet open and inviting call.When I visited this place with my Korean friend's son, we stood at the base of these steps for a few pictures. When I later viewed the pictures, a young girl was sitting by the accordion player midway up the steps gesturing with two 'V's', which is a sign of peace. At the nearby Korean railway station is the Gate of Peace, a beautiful expectation of the future in our hopes and hearts.The Forty Steps mark a bridge for many people. This place reminds us of the need to bring together the divided. This fundamental tendency in humanity is neither our only tendency nor perhaps the major human drive. Yet, the Forty Steps calmly and perennially calls on the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the entire world to deal with and honor the memory and sufferings of the Korean people. The Forty Steps represent life, which is a fundamental human purpose, and my dear Korea, may we never forget it!Bernard Rowan is associate provost for contract administration and professor of political science at ChicagoStateUniversity.

Moon said in a video message to the Jeju Forum. ??The Republic of Korea will take the lead in the peninsula issues without leaning on the role of other countries.?? The North??s ongoing series of missile tests poses a critical challenge to the peace and stability of not only the peninsula but the world, Moon said, vowing to strongly deal with its provocations. ??If North Korea presses ahead with armed provocations, I clearly promise I will sternly retaliate with the robust alliance with the US and our own defense capabilities so as to safeguard peace,?? he said. The remarks came shortly after Pyongyang carried out its third test of a ballistic missile since the president took office on May 10. The ceaseless provocations have triggered concerns that Moon??s pursuit of a thaw with the unruly regime may drive a wedge in the partnership between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo. Moon sent mixed signals during the speech. While seeking to ease concerns, he at the same time introduced his vision to foster an ??inter-Korean economic community?? that he said would pave the way for lasting peace on the peninsula. This was part of his election pledge calling for a ??New Korean Peninsula Economic Map.?? It envisions formulating joint industrial zones and traffic networks along the eastern and western coastal areas including by reopening the now closed Kaesong industrial park and Mount Kumkang, which critics say would help fatten the Kim Jong-un regime??s coffers and may breach international sanctions. ??A peaceful peninsula is no longer a dream,?? Moon said. ??During my term, I will bring about a novel milestone in fostering peace on the peninsula.?? The president stressed the need to continue addressing the North??s human rights issues, pledging to enhance the country??s policy and system ??without hesitance as a universal value of humanity?? in collaboration with the international community. He also promised to continue a fact-finding probe and efforts to recover the honor of those hurt by an uprising on April 3, 1969, during which more than 14,000 Jeju residents who were fighting against a controversial election were killed by riot police. For the first time this year, the Jeju Forum hosted a special session on the massacre ahead of its 70th anniversary, which Moon said he hoped would provide a chance to heal the suffering and wounds of the islanders. ??Tens of thousands of benign residents were sacrificed for the sake of ideology, a pain we had to suffer from at the forefront of the global Cold War,?? the president said. ??We will fulfill all lingering state responsibilities going forward, including further fact-finding activities and helping regain the victims?? honors,?? he added, noting a 2006 formal apology and a comprehensive investigation by then President Roh Moo-hyun to whom he was chief of staff.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: MISSILE SYSTEMS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (76%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (71%); INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY (69%); HUMAN RIGHTS (64%); DEATHS & INJURIES BY POLICE (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%); KIM JONG UN (58%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (93%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (76%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); CHINA (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 1, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

The school held a fall art exhibition last month, comprised of creative pieces by students in pre-kindergarten to 12th grade. Under the theme of 'Chroma,' the exhibition featured a multitude of color celebrating the diversity of experiences and ideas that students brought through their art. 'Students self-curate their work, reflect on their outcomes, and receive valuable feedback from visitors and fellow students alike. Young artists at KIS are also able to see themselves as real artists and envision a future path in the creative arts,ï'said Candice Kim, head of the Visual Arts Department at KIS.In an effort to expand the reach of their art skills and in conjunction with the KIS Service Learning initiatives -- a program which KIS has launched to help students participate in service to grow together as a community -- students from the elementary to high school collaborate to create a coloring book. All proceeds from this activity go to the Nabiya cat shelter, the school said. Each fall, art students participate in charity activities utilizing their artistic skills. Since 2015, middle school students have been making coloring books. The following year, the school also hosted a silent auction of student-made potteries to benefit orphanages in Suji and Suwon.Catherine Kim is one of the KIS students who have been reaching out to the community through the program since 2013. She has been applying her artistic knowledge by offering mentoring to underprivileged students from 1st to 6th grade at Chungsol Community Welfare Center. Through the National Art Honor Society, Kim also formed a committee of dedicated volunteers. 'The most rewarding thing about teaching other students has been the reciprocal learning, which taught both myself and the students,ï'she said. KIS said it will host Fine Arts Week from April 16-20. This weeklong event will focus on how to appreciate art outside the classroom and apply it throughout all areas. Students in the Advanced Placement art course will sponsor a gallery showing slated for May 21-25.'It will be a culminating experience highlighting all of the technical and creative skills they have acquired throughout their art career,ï'KIS said.By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (78%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (78%); HIGH SCHOOLS (78%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (78%); SERVICE LEARNING (78%); MUSEUMS & GALLERIES (78%); CHILDREN (73%); VISUAL ARTS (73%); ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAMS (73%); AUCTIONS (72%); VOLUNTEERS (70%); ANIMAL SHELTERS & RESCUES (66%); ANIMAL WELFARE (66%); CATS (51%)LOAD-DATE: November 30, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

This year it was Hyun See-won, co-director of Seoul's Audio Visual Pavilion. Hyun majored in Korean language and literature and art history at Ewha Womans University, and earned her master's degree from the Korea National University of Arts.The independent curator said that when she was asked to organize an exhibition for the white cube space, she focused on her curiosity.""Instead of picking up just young artists, I tried to find the artworks that I want to observe closely,"" Hyun said. ""I wondered about these four artists' perspectives on the world and wanted to ask them questions.""Hyun's question is restructured in the theme of the exhibit, ""A Snowflake,"" inspired by British mathematician Ian Stewart's book ""What Shape is a Snowflake?"" Each snowflake is unique, affected by various conditions, and Hyun juxtaposed the question of process of investigation and time and research to the artists.The four artists use different mediums to express their ideas. Gim is a photographer, while Park clings to traditional painting. Lee works with sculptures and Choi collects images from the internet.""These artists are interested in reality and their works reflect reality,' Hyun said. 'Their works also physically take time to make. I thought they were the right people to answer the questions of medium in art in 2017.""The artworks are displayed in a cinematic way. ""At the entrance, Gim and Choi's works act as an outside of the exhibition, showcasing reality visible in their works,' Hyun said. 'The back room is more surreal, featuring Park's paintings and Lee's sculptures.""The artists also took part in designing the space. Painter Park said: ""The flow of human traffic can also tell stories. We decided which artwork will go where, as if editing a film and assigning scenes.""Choi Yun's works are related to nature and how images are fabricated and the crafted image tricks the cognitive system. ""Liquid Crystal Bubble Future Display"" consists of lenticular images collected from the web.""These lenticular images amazed me when I was a child, but the novelty soon wore off and these became old-fashioned,' Choi said. 'I collected images to throw the question of how people objectify nature through systematically collected images.""Gim's ""Raptured"" series deals with the time and space of the 1990s, when society was in confusion with issues such as eschatology, the new millennium and accidents, including the collapse of the Sampoong Department Store.Instead of taking photos, Gim created a collage of rendered images of an apartment complex as evidence of the time.Park's paintings might look traditional, but her thoughts behind the canvas are modern.""I try to find clues for phenomena,' Park said. 'For me, landscape is a kind of virtual reality and my paintings are the result of my attempt to bring the landscape to the surface. It's a kind of desert of the real, and the particles of the acrylic paint are like grains of sand in the desert.""Lee's sculptures are intuitive as she renders concepts such as hysteria, elegance and catharsis into them.""I am interested in making things with my hands,' Lee said. 'I am fascinated by the energy coming from 3D objects and the poetic metaphor of materials. Catharsis is expressed through heavy cement, while hysteria is sharp and pointed like aluminum.""Hyun said: ""Artists are people who make their own principles based on definite, subjective and poetic imaginations.

As the situation improves in Syria it is natural that the refugees will begin to return to their country'.Noting that Lebanon, which sheltered some 1.5 million Syrian refugees ? equal to about a third of the Mediterranean country's total population of 4.5 million people ? was under enormous pressure, Wang vowed increased Chinese assistance to help Lebanon deal with the refugee crisis.Analysts believed Wang's comments showed Beijing was not ready to change its stance on the refugee issue.'China has been playing an increasingly active role in the Syrian conflict, but I don't think China is considering to provide shelter to people fleeing Syria or other war-torn Middle East nations,' said Hua Liming, a former Chinese ambassador to Iran.'To be fair, it is not that China has explicitly refused to shelter Syrian refugees or those displaced by war and conflicts in the region. More importantly, refugees from the Middle East usually choose Arab nations or developed countries, such as the US and Europe, instead of China'.Li Guofu, a Middle East specialist with the China Institute of International Studies, also said China was not an ideal destination for Middle Eastern refugees due to religious, cultural and political considerations.'Wang's remarks were in line with Beijing's long-standing policy on the Middle East, which tried to stay away from domestic violence of other nations while trying to live up to its international obligation by providing financial and other humanitarian assistance,' he said.Shen Jiru, of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, also said it was not fair to expect China to 'clean up the mess' in Syria left by the US-led coalition.'Despite China still being a developing nation with our own poverty, population and other development problems, it has done its job to help resolve the Syrian crisis. The US and its allies should take greater responsibility for the refugee issue because it was their interventionist policies that created the crisis in the first place,' Shen said.Of the record number of 22.5 million refugees globally at the end of last year, 5.5 million were forced to flee Syria, according to United Nations statistics.On top of nearly 700 million yuan (US$102 million) over the years, China pledged in January to invest another 200 million yuan to help Middle Eastern nations deal with the refugee crisis.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: REFUGEES (97%); SYRIAN CRISIS (92%); REFUGEE & RELIEF CAMPS (90%); MIGRATION ISSUES (90%); EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS (90%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (89%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (89%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (89%); WAR & CONFLICT (89%); EMERGENCY SHELTERS (78%); DISPLACED PERSONS (78%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (77%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (77%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (76%); CIVIL WAR (76%); 2011 SYRIAN UPRISING (74%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (74%); POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (71%); DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (71%); POLITICS (69%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (64%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (60%); RELIGION (50%)CITY: BEIRUT, LEBANON (92%); BEIJING, CHINA (90%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (94%)COUNTRY: SYRIA (99%); MIDDLE EAST (98%); CHINA (97%); LEBANON (94%); STATE OF PALESTINE (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); MEDITERRANEAN (79%); EUROPE (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 27, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Le Guin, Ann Patchett voted into arts academy   THE KOREA HERALD February 28, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDFebruary 28, 2017 TuesdayUrsula K. Le Guin, Ann Patchett voted into arts academy LENGTH: 679 wordsUrsula K. Le Guin, Ann Patchett voted into arts academyNEW YORK (AP) -- Not even an honorary National Book Award kept Ursula K. Le Guin from being surprised by her latest tribute: membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.``My reputation was made as a writer of fantasy and science fiction, a literature that has mostly gone without such honors,â€˜â€™ she told the Associated Press recently.Known for such classics as ``The Left Hand of Darknessâ€˜â€™ and ``The Dispossessed,â€˜â€™ Le Guin has won numerous science fiction and fantasy awards, but only in recent years has she received more literary recognition, notably a National Book Award medal in 2014. The arts academy, an honorary society with a core membership of 250 writers, artists, composers and architects, once shunned ``genreâ€˜â€™ writers such as Le Guin. Even such giants as science fiction writer Ray Bradbury and crime novelist Elmore Leonard never got in.Academy member Michael Chabon, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, advocated for Le Guin.``As a deviser of worlds, as a literary stylist, as a social critic and as a storyteller, Le Guin has no peer,â€˜â€™ he wrote in his recommendation, shared with the AP, that she be admitted. ``From the time of her first published work in the mid-1960s, she began to push against the confines of science fiction, bringing to bear an anthropologistâ€˜s acute eye for large social textures and mythic structures, a fierce egalitarianism and a remarkable gift of language, without ever renouncing the sense of wonder and the spirit of play inherent in her genre of origin.â€™â€˜The 87-year-old Le Guin is one of 14 new core members, the academy told the AP. Others include fiction writers Junot Diaz, Ann Patchett, Amy Hempel and Colum McCann, former US poet laureate Kay Ryan and fellow poets Henri Cole and Edward Hirsch. The academy also voted in the artists Mary Heilmann, Julie Mehretu and Stanley Whitney, architect Annabelle Selldorf and composers Melinda Wagner and Julia Wolfe.Three foreign honorary members were added: authors Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Zadie Smith and composer Kaija Saariaho.The arts academy was founded in 1898, with members since ranging from Henry James and William Dean Howells to Chuck Close and Stephen Sondheim. The new inductees will be formally welcomed at a ceremony at the New York-based academy in May, where academy member Joyce Carol Oates will deliver the centennial Blashfield Foundation keynote address. Previous speakers have included Helen Keller, Robert Frost and Robert Caro.Patchett, author of the acclaimed ``Bel Cantoâ€™â€˜ and most recently ``Commonwealth,â€™â€˜ said she had tears in her eyes after learning she had been selected. Years earlier, she had been given a prize by the academy, presented to her by John Updike.``They could have just given me the Getting-To-Eat-Lunch-With John-Updike award and that would have been the biggest thrill of my life,â€™â€˜ she told the AP. ``This is an institution where all of my heroes gather. I am very moved that theyâ€™ve invited me in.â€˜â€™Diaz, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his novel ``The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,â€˜â€™ told the AP that he was surprised to get into the academy, in part because he was informed in an old-fashioned way -- by letter.``No one sends letters anymore,â€˜â€™ he wrote recently in a more prevalent form of communication, email.Le Guin lives in Portland, Oregon, and will not be attending the May ceremony. For a time, she didnâ€˜t even know she had been chosen. Blame it on the risks of sending paper letters.``(T)he academyâ€™s written invitation never got to me,â€˜â€™ she said, adding that she feared comparisons to Bob Dylan, who took more than two weeks to personally respond to winning the Nobel Prize for literature. ``I found out theyâ€˜d been waiting days or weeks for a reply. I thought: `Oh, no, theyâ€™ll think Iâ€˜ve been pulling a Dylan on them!â€™â€˜â€™cap:This Oct. 16, 2012, file photo shows author Ann Patchett at The David H. Koch Theater in New York.

(East Asia Foundation)Referring to the ""Zero Option"" security policy proposed by the US to withdraw all Soviet and American intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe in the early 1980s, Song said a similar strategy could create more opportunity for negotiations on limiting Pyongyang's nuclear development and missile deployment.US President Ronald Reagan made the proposal in 1981 not to proceed with the scheduled deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles, on the condition that the Soviet Union remove its SS-4, SS-5 and SS-20 missiles targeting Western Europe.Under the leadership of Soviet Secretary-General Mikhail Gorbachev, the USSR soon returned to nuclear arms control negotiations and the Zero Option constituted the basis of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, agreed in principle in September 1987 and signed on Dec. 8 that year.A total of 2,692 Soviet and US nuclear missiles were eliminated under the treaty by the end of May 1991. This multilateral agreement -- which removed both intermediate and shorter-range nuclear forces from Europe, dubbed the ""Double Zero"" deal -- is widely regarded as a key part of ending the Cold War.North Korea has gone for broke to harness its nuclear program, Song said, for the purpose of upgrading its technical and defense capabilities, stabilizing the regime's rule and gaining an upper hand in diplomacy.Under leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea has significantly upgraded its weapons capabilities, undertaking 36 ballistic missile tests and three nuclear tests over the last five years. In a New Year's address, Kim Jong-un claimed that ""preparations for testing an intercontinental ballistic missile is nearing the end,"" signaling it will soon test-fire an ICBM that could directly hit the US mainland.The administration of US President Donald Trump, for its part, is unlikely to invest much political energy in the North Korean problem, he projected, as it has proved highly difficult to negotiate with. However, once Washington finds the issue aligned with its interests facing the midterm election or re-election, the administration could try to negotiate with Pyongyang more proactively, he added.Arguing that South Korea and its allies and partners ""have not gone to the bottom to negotiate the nuclear impasse,"" Song stressed that ""the issue is inseparable from the Korean Peninsula's unification"" and ""South Korea should pursue a diplomacy that transcends political calculations and administrations.""Song Min-soon, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul and a foreign minister from 2006-8 (East Asia Foundation)Jun Bong-geun, professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, said Pyongyang has constitutionally laid down its nuclear armament as ""fait accompli,"" with its nuclear doctrine specifically targeting South Korea.""Although it is hard to see North Korea's nuclear strategy as having been firmly established, using weapons will not likely be institutionally decided, relying instead on Kim Jong-un's ad hoc call,"" Jun said. ""The North Korean leader's pugnacious and temerarious character, gross disregard for human rights and humanity, lack of governing experience and capricious and impulsive decision-making are grave risk factors in the possible decision to use the nukes.""Unlike the ""no-first-use"" principle of China -- which stipulates that nuclear weapons will only be used in a retaliatory measure against an enemy's preemptive nuclear strike -- the North's nuclear principle is more aggressive and threatening, the professor explained.""Despite Pyongyang's advocacy of a 'no-first-use' principle in its nuclear doctrine, with the necessary condition of its 'sovereignty under attack by nuclear weapons,' the regime will make decisions arbitrarily,"" he said. ""As South Korea is an ally of the nuclear superpower US, and they together have conducted joint military exercises, enforced international sanctions and criticized the regime, Pyongyang will probably interpret all of these measures as 'violating its sovereignty using nuclear force.'""In consequence, North Korea has opened the possibility of attacking South Korea using a first strike and preemptive strike, he added.The academic also said Pyongyang will likely pursue a ""very aggressive"" nuclear strategy -- comprised of a posture and doctrine -- by maximizing its second strike capability and hostile posture toward the South.Noting the US and Russia each possess over 7,000 nuclear weapons and Britain, France, China, Israel, India and Pakistan have between 100 and 300 each, Jun said North Korea -- estimated to own about 10 nukes -- could multiply its weapons stock to 100 over the next 10 years, if it continued its current course.However, due to the weapons' diminishing utility and excessive operating cost, the regime will not likely increase its capacity infinitely, he added.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NUCLEAR WEAPONS (94%); MILITARY WEAPONS (91%); ARMS CONTROL & DISARMAMENT (91%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (90%); DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY (90%); ARMS RACE (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (89%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (89%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (84%); WEAPONS DECOMMISSIONING (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); COLD WAR (78%); FOREIGN POLICY (77%); US PRESIDENTS (77%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (76%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (71%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (68%)ORGANIZATION: ASIA FOUNDATION (54%)PERSON: RONALD REAGAN (79%); DONALD TRUMP (76%); KIM JONG UN (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (96%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (93%); EUROPE (93%); INDIA (79%); WESTERN EUROPE (79%); EASTERN ASIA (79%); PAKISTAN (79%); ISRAEL (79%); IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: February 27, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Earlier in the day, Moon offered condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. student who died after being returned home in a coma following 17 months of detention in North Korea, and criticized the North's human rights abuses. / Courtesy of Cheong Wa DaePresident slams North Korea over US student's deathOtto WarmbierPresident Moon Jae-in harshly criticized North Korea, Tuesday, for its human rights abuses following the death of a U.S. citizen who was returned home in a coma after 17 months of detention in the North.His death is expected to worsen already-strained U.S.-North Korea relations and push the Donald Trump administration to adopt a harder attitude toward the reclusive state ahead of a summit with Moon next week.Cheong Wa Dae said Tuesday that the President sent a telegram of condolence to the family of Otto Warmbier, 22, a former University of Virginia student who died Monday, six days after he was released from North Korea.His family said Warmbier died of the 'torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans.''Moon offered his condolences to the family,' presidential spokesman Park Soo-hyun said. 'He also deplored the fact that the North does not respect human rights, a universal value of humanity.'In an interview with foreign media the previous day, the President raised the question over whether North Korea fulfilled its humanitarian responsibility such as telling the family immediately when Warmbier's condition took a turn for the worse, and offering the best possible medical treatment for Warmbier.¡®Dialogue with NK is necessary'President Moon told CBS in an interview Tuesday that North Korea had a 'heavy' responsibility in the process that led to Warmbier's death.However, the President said dialogue with the North was necessary since South Korea has failed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through only sanctions and pressure.Moon also believed his position was not at odds with that of President Trump's policy toward the North.'It seems to me that President Trump has criticized the failed former policies of his predecessors. And on that point, I have the same view as President Trump,' Moon said in the interview.He also made it clear that dialogue with Pyongyang will not happen unless certain conditions are met.A freeze of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs should come first, followed by the complete dismantlement of its nuclear programs, Moon said. Asked whether he would support a pre-emptive strike on the North, the President said he believed this could be discussed among the relevant heads of state if a threat becomes more urgent.He also said he hoped that conditions would become right for dialogue before the end of the year.'Just because we believe dialogue is necessary does not mean we have to be impatient for it,' President Moon said.Trump may suggest adding more pressure on the North over its nuclear programs rather than engagement during the summit with Moon in Washington, D.C., slated for June 29 and 30. The two leaders may have difficulty in coming to a unified opinion, as Moon's basic stance is to seek both sanctions and dialogue and a step-by-step resolution of the nuclear issue.Trump said in a statement, 'Otto's fate deepens my administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.'Republican Senator John McCain even said Warmbier was 'murdered by the Kim Jong-un regime.' 'The United States of America cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers,' he said in a statement.The Seoul government is watching how the situation develops and whether details about Warmbier's demise will be uncovered, such as how he fell into a coma. If he died from the results of torture or other mistreatment as his family claims, negative public sentiment toward Pyongyang in the U.S. and the international community will grow.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DEATH & DYING (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); INTERVIEWS (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (74%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (69%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (93%); DONALD TRUMP (89%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: June 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The recent emergence of these alternative drugs have begun to threaten the exclusivity of some of the world's top selling pharmaceuticals, held by a handful of global pharma giants.The EMA has approved Truxima for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.With the approval, Truxima can now be sold at 28 European Union member states including the UK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.Celltrion said it would continue to work with its marketing partners for Europe -- including Mundipharma, Biogaran and Kern Pharma -- to begin selling Truxima across Europe from the second quarter, starting with the UK.""We expect Truxima to secure a strong competitive edge in the global market for monoclonal antibody drugs as it faces no competitors other than the original drug Rituxan,"" Celltrion said in a statement.Truxima is likely to be the only Rituxan biosimilar in the market for the time being, though competing drugs are on their way.Novartis-owned Sandoz submitted its own biosimilar referencing Rituxan to the EMA for approval in May 2016, while Pfizer and Amgen are wrapping up third-phase clinical trials of their own Rituxan biosimilars.Truxima is Celltrion's second biosimilar to be commercialized in Europe. The Korean drugmaker began selling Remsima, its biosimilar referencing Remicade, in Europe in February 2015 and in the US (sold as Inflectra) from November 2016.Rituxan, also sold as Mabthera, was originally developed by Biogen and is sold globally by US pharmaceutical giant Roche. It is the world's second top-selling drug, having generated sales of more than $7 billion last year.Celltrion plans to file Truxima for review by the US Food and Drug Administration by early next year as well, with hopes of becoming the first to introduce a Rituxan biosimilar in the US.In addition to Remsima and Truxima, Celltrion is currently seeking the EMA's approval of another biosimilar drug called Herzuma -- referencing Roche's Herceptin. The Korean drugmaker plans to file the drug for approval by the US FDA as well.Celltrion holds high expectations for its three biosimilar drugs -- all of which are or will become the first biosimilar versions of their respective originator drugs to enter major markets.""Together, the three originator drugs targeted by our biosimilars account for a global market worth around 25 trillion won ($21.5 billion),"" Celltrion said.""By selling our products at 30-40 percent discounted prices, we can target a market worth at least 15-17 trillion won.

It's not the main source of concern as of now,' Jeff Dean, head of the Google Brain team that focuses on AI and machine learning research, told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. '(Rather,) I think the question of 'narrow AI' is definitely where we are now. The systems we have now are good at one thing or another. We're trying to build an AI that can be more useful across wider domains,ï'he said during Google's annual #MadeWithAI conference for the Asia-Pacific region.According to the veteran Google engineer, the 'same techniques and precautions used in traditional software programming (to ensure a program runs properly) can be used to deploy safe AI systems.'In the long run, machine learning can automate tasks that are more repetitive and simplistic, and in turn enable people to do more in conjunction with technology, he suggested. While AI-driven automation will lead to some job loss -- as has been the case with new technologies in the past -- Dean believes it will also create entirely new jobs unknown as of now.His optimistic outlook on artificial intelligence align with the broad direction of Google, which has set out to lead in 'a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available,ï'as put by Google CEO Sundar Pichai.The California-based tech giant aims to leverage such technologies to make its products more useful, help businesses and external developer innovate, and to support researchers in tackling humanity's biggest challenges, Dean said.Leading the push is Google Brain, the team responsible for developing and experimenting with various forms of machine learning and neural networks to make computers smarter. Machine learning, the most widely used form of artificial intelligence, refers to computer algorithms that can learn to perform particular tasks on their own, rather than operating based on hand-coded rules programmed by humans. The most popular form of machine learning is deep learning, which uses artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in. This complex method allows computers to recognize patterns and make conclusive observations on their own, without the need for human programming.AI experts from Google provided updates on how machine learning algorithms are being used to improve its key products and solve problems across different industries.For instance, Google Maps leverages AI-powered vision technology to create maps with only satellite imagery and street views, allowing it to build viable maps in places where official street information is unavailable. For YouTube, AI-based natural language processing algorithms are used to automatically caption videos uploaded on the platform to benefit users who are deaf or hard of hearing.In health care, Google is using deep learning to train machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in the eye or cancerous tumors.As Google continues its artificial intelligence push, the company says it is seeking to train more computer scientists in machine learning to encourage further development in the field. It plans to launch by early next year a free, online 'machine learning crash courseï'for the public.The tech giant is also spearheading a project called AutoML, short for automated machine learning, with the goal of essentially building an artificial intelligence that builds other AIs.By Sohn Ji-young (jys@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (95%); COMPUTER EQUIPMENT (89%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (78%); SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY FILMS (73%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (71%); SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & ENGINEERING (66%); COMPUTER PROGRAMMING (66%); JOB CREATION (64%); DISMISSALS (64%)COMPANY: GOOGLE INC (98%); AI SYSTEMS (54%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (98%); SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE (54%)PERSON: SUNDAR PICHAI (73%)CITY: TOKYO, JAPAN (56%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (55%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (87%); JAPAN (56%); ASIA (55%); UNITED STATES (55%)LOAD-DATE: November 29, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

An older brother and I   only 11 years old at the time   were separated from our family in Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. We were not reunited for several days and, upon our return home, we learned that two of our close neighbors had died.It is one thing to view war at a distance and read about its casualties and another to live it.How many of us must become casualties or collateral damage before the lessons of conflict and war are learned? How many of our children must be compelled to address life-and-death questions and not be allowed to dream of hope and peace? Isn??t it time that we stop rationalizing our existence in a way that disempowers the other?There is enough blame to go around; innocence is not the exclusive domain of one individual or community.In war, we become hostage to and victims of fear and insecurity. There are better ways to resolve conflict than through violence. Violence is not a path toward peace.Whether we all like it or not, Israelis and Palestinians are and will be neighbors forever. The Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea are the garden fences of our respective homes and the bookends of our respective narratives. The sooner we grasp our reality, the quicker we can work through the issues that divide us.Whether we all like it or not, whatever separates us religiously is minuscule to what unites us. The wells of goodness tap into the same source. Only by honoring each other??s religion can we be faithful to our own.Whether we all like it or not, the space between us nationally is also minuscule. While we have inhabited the same land for generations, we have forgotten the meaning of inclusion and sharing. Let our amnesia dissolve into the reservoir of acknowledging our own wrongs and considering each other??s rights.Palestinians and Israelis have a responsibility toward each other. Wishing each other away is foolishness. Conspiring or acting to neutralize each other is illegal and sacrilegious and it runs counter to humanity??s ethical and spiritual values.We must change our minds and change our ways. Crossing the border, physically and psychologically, is definitely possible.On the morning of June 5, 1967, I heard Jordan??s King Hussein asking his citizens to fight the enemy (the Israelis) ??wherever you find them.?? Yet on Oct. 23, 1998, just months before his death, he pleaded for peace during the Wye River Middle East conference.Egypt??s Sadat was a main architect of 1973??s war against Israel. Yet, on Nov. 19, 1977, he landed in Israel and opened the door to direct negotiations that culminated in the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of March 26, 1979.Israel??s Yitzhak Rabin, who commanded the Israel Defense Forces in the Six-Day War, spoke on behalf of the Israeli people at the signing of the Oslo Accords, ??We who have fought against you, the Palestinians; we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice, enough of blood and tears ... enough!??Unfortunately, both Sadat and Rabin were assassinated by extremists within their respective community. But, that is why there is an urgent need to have leaders at all levels of our societies stand up and demand change for peace.We must impress upon those in authority to be empathic with the other and to rise above ideology, party politics, national identity and religious affiliation. Is not the main goal of good governance to advocate for all citizens equally, to manage needs, and to resolve conflict so as to create social justice, peace, and prosperity?We must support peacebuilding efforts underway in Israel and Palestine so we can promote education for peace, a vision for shared society, religious freedom, and pluralism. We need to be ready to truly live peace once an agreement is reached.It is time that we turn our nightmares and suffering into hopeful dreams and positive action. This year must not pass without each of us contributing to the mosaic that is peace.By Saliba Sarsar Saliba Sarsar is a professor of political science at Monmouth University in New Jersey.

But instead of vilifying Kim and his executives, he spoke, in a solemn, placid manner, for millions of South Koreans whose left-behind loved ones are suffering across the border.Oh Joon (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)""For South Koreans, people in North Korea are not just anybodies,"" he said.""Even though we never hear from them and even though by now the pain of separation has become a cold fact of life, we know that they are there, just a few hundred kilometers away from where we live.""We only hope that one day in the future, when we look back on what we did today, we'll be able to say that we did the right thing for the people of North Korea, for the lives of every man and woman, boy and girl, who has the same human rights as the rest of us.""The brief, offhand speech touched the hearts of not only other UN envoys but also the South Koreans back home, especially the young generations who are relatively less interested in North Korea's human rights situation or a unification. The clip went viral, and Oh's social network accounts were instantly flooded with friend requests.""To others, the human rights violations may just seem gruesome and barbaric. But to us, it's something that's happening to our sisters and brothers. So I thought I had to share how we feel about it,"" Oh said during a recent interview with The Korea Herald.After an illustrious 38-year career, the ambassador retired from the Foreign Ministry last December, now teaching at Kyung Hee University's Graduate Institute of Peace Studies in Seoul.Throughout his four terms at the UN, he witnessed the living history of a divided Korea. Among the most memorable episodes was a flag-raising ceremony marking the two Koreas' joining in 1991, a work he was involved in as a young second secretary at the mission.""As the two flags were put up, I thought one day, before I retire from the diplomatic service, they might merge into one, but that never happened, to my disappointment,"" he said.""Outside the fences, protestors were yelling 'Korea is one, Korea is one!' saying they should have joined after a unification. That is still vivid in my memory as if I still hear their voices -- it made me think about our people and national division.""As the ambassador, Oh was behind the making of the two strongest sets of UNSC sanctions against North Korea, Resolution 2270 and 2321, each adopted last March and November.Concerns have been growing, however, Beijing may loosen its enforcement in the face of plans to station a US missile shield in South Korea, which it vehemently decries.Yet Oh was adamant that China will be one of the biggest victims of a nuclear-armed North, which would shake the regional strategic balance, prompt other countries to take countermeasures and further damage its interests in turn.""If North Korea indeed becomes a nuclear weapons state, others would strive to restore the status quo, matching the capability by whatever means. That's the least China would want to see in its security strategy,"" he said.""But I think all parties can put down all of their concerns and have frank discussions to find the right solution. Just because you don't like others' decisions, you can't respond with economic and cultural measures. It doesn't help anyone.""As one of closest diplomats to former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Oh has been assisting him before and after their return home.The interview was carried out before Ban backed out of a presidential bid Wednesday. Asked on the issue Thursday, Oh displayed respect for Ban's decision, offering an upbeat outlook for his future contribution to society.""As a global leader, I believe (Ban) will be able to make various contributions to the international community. At home, he also has a role as a mentor in society, whoever becomes the next president,"" Oh said.In the eyes of the seasoned diplomat, the ongoing political tumult, set off by a presidential scandal and ensuing impeachment campaign, could provide a chance to minimize ""growing pains"" from the country's rapid economic ascent.""There is a gap between the people's expectations and what's really happening in our society,"" Oh said.""The right way to go is to match the reality with the expectations, and we need to think about how a political leadership can meet them.""At 62, Oh is enjoying his days as a ""freeman"" -- he was given, for the first time in nearly four decades, the time to think about what he would make of the rest of his life.He has a long-cherished vision: becoming a boost to civil society, with a focus on the rights of those with disabilities or North Korean defectors, capitalizing on his UN experience including as president of the Economic and Social Council.""Looking at history, we, as a human species, have been taking a certain direction that we share individual knowledge and build on past achievements. I think that's basically what humanity is about -- a process,"" Oh said.""Where the process is going? Honestly I don't know. But there must be meanings, and I want to contribute to them.""By Shin Hyon-hee (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (78%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (78%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (78%); INTERVIEWS (72%); SOCIAL NETWORKING (64%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (61%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (73%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (97%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%)LOAD-DATE: February 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Davis, who has been in city jails for four-and-half years, insisted it was self-defense against Han Ki-suck, 58, who had accosted him in the city's 49th Street subway station.Jury forewoman Gretchen Pfeil, who teaches linguistic anthropology at New York University, said after the verdict: 'I think the vast majority of us from the beginning of our deliberations believed the prosecution had failed to prove the defendant was not justified in his actions. And by the end of our deliberations, I believe we were of one mind that he was in fact justified in his actions.'About 12:30 p.m. on December 3, 2012, Han, who was drunk, accosted and swore at Davis, a homeless refugee, after they accidentally bumped into each other near a turnstile.Han followed Davis down to the subway platform and kept harassing him, grabbing his shoulder. Davis, frustrated, shoved him away, causing the Korean to fall onto the tracks.Han was too drunk to climb back and a train crushed him to death a few minutes later. Davis reportedly 'freaked' and fled, according to the Daily Mail.The incident received wide attention after The New York Post showed a photo of Han about to be crushed by the train, headlined 'Doomed.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (92%); DEATH & DYING (90%); MANSLAUGHTER (90%); JURY TRIALS (90%); RAIL STATIONS & TERMINALS (89%); CITY LIFE (78%); TRAINS (78%); VERDICTS (76%); HOMICIDE (76%); ACQUITTAL (76%); MURDER (76%); WITNESSES (76%); INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER (75%); TESTIMONY (74%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); NEGLIGENCE (70%); REFUGEES (65%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (52%); LINGUISTICS (52%)COMPANY: NEW YORK RESTAURANT GROUP INC (92%)INDUSTRY: SIC5812 EATING PLACES (92%)CITY: NEW YORK, NY, USA (92%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (93%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: July 19, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Professor Lee Hyun-jae of the University of Seoul's Institute for Urban Humanities was criticized for comments in September when she appeared on a TV talk show and shared her thoughts on sexual complexes. The professor argued at the time that the Shotaro complex -- sexual attraction for young boys by adults -- is not of the same characteristic as the Lolita complex for young girls, adding a predilection for young boys could be considered a 'preferenceï'rather than irregular practice. Her remarks have come under scrutiny again after a Korean national authored a written account of sexual abuse of an underage Australian boy on an online misandrists community on Sunday. Lee took to social media Tuesday to clarify her position. She said she thinks of 'acts motivated by the Shotaro complexï'as serious crimes that should be punished. 'Shotaro complex motivated concepts, however, are something new in the history of male hegemony,ï'she wrote. 'The concepts are questionable, but the appearance of 'beautiful boysï'is a new preference of the era.ï'She added that 'the media outlets that report stories (about me), unrelated to the facts will take responsibility.ï'Her attempt at clarification, however, was largely received as unsatisfactory, lending itself to further criticism.

Korea crisis finally bring China and US together?BYLINE: By Laura ZhouLENGTH: 643 wordsA demonstration by North Korean military forces to celebrate its army's 85th anniversary, as broadcast in a news bulletin in North Korea on April 26, 2017.Despite differences in priorities, the two powers have come together to deal with Pyongyang's challenge, analysts sayThe rising crisis over North Korea's nuclear ambitions has forced China and the United States to work together ? at least for now ? but tensions remain high in the Korean Peninsula.Regional observers say the two powers have come together in an effort to deal with North Korea.'Both nations have been continuing to coordinate on the North Korea issues after the Trump-Xi summit as there is a gap in the understanding between the two governments,' said Li Kaisheng, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.'Trump is tough on North Korea and the Chinese government needs to express its own position as an unstable Korean Peninsula is the last thing Beijing wants, so frequent negotiation within a short period of time is necessary.'Though China and the US differed on their priorities on the North Korean crisis, the issue was where both sides could find common ground, according to Sun Xingjie, a Korean affairs expert from Jilin University.This was especially so compared with other more contentious issues such as the South China Sea and trade, he said.China's biggest concern was a new nuclear test by Pyongyang, while the US was more worried about the North's inter-continental missile capabilities, he added.'One of the major changes [after the Mar-a-Lago summit] is that China and the US are willing to team up in the face of the challenge from North Korea, and together draw a red line against the North,' Sun said.While the situation in the Korean Peninsula seemed 'very tense', the danger of a full-fledged crisis 'should not be exaggerated', the academic said.'The US apparently is not ready for a military strike against North Korea and it still has to depend on China to reign in nuclear-armed Pyongyang and defuse the tension.'But North Korea has thus far remained defiant, raising fears that it could spark war ? forcing China's hand ? if it continued on its retaliative path of launching military attacks on US facilities in the region.Ties between Beijing and Pyongyang have come under renewed strain in recent months, especially after China abruptly cut off coal imports from the North in February.Wu Dawei, China's top envoy for North Korean nuclear affairs, was reportedly rebuffed when he requested to meet his North Korean counterpart, according to Bloomberg last week.The snub raised questions about Beijing's influence over the North Korean leader, Kim, and also suggested a shift in the reclusive state's attitude towards its sole ally.Just a month ago in an interview with Phoenix TV, Jang Song Chol, North Korea's Consul General to Hong Kong, said Pyongyang would stand with Beijing and Moscow in the face of challenges from the US and South Korea.Jang also remarked that the Trump administration was still 'searching in the dark' on its North Korean policy.Huang Jing, an international relations specialist from the National University of Singapore, said Beijing knew Pyongyang desired direct dialogue and normalisation of bilateral ties with Washington, so it was in fact the US ? rather than China ? that had been reluctant to resolve the North Korean issue.'Washington clearly saw benefits to using North Korea to tighten its grip on its key regional allies, South Korea and Japan,' Huang said. 'It also tried to make use of China's dilemma on North Korea to create problems for Beijing, for example, depriving Beijing of the moral high ground by stalling the six-party talks.'The six-party talks are multilateral negotiations involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the US aimed at dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programme.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARMIES (90%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (89%); ANNIVERSARIES (89%); NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS (78%); IMPORT TRADE (75%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (68%); COAL EXPORTS & IMPORTS (50%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); BEIJING, CHINA (88%); SHANGHAI, CHINA (72%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (90%); JILIN, CHINA (79%); SOUTH CHINA SEA (79%); NORTHEAST CHINA (79%); EAST CHINA (77%); PACIFIC OCEAN (54%)COUNTRY: CHINA (98%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (97%); UNITED STATES (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: May 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The class also will be open to members of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE), a research and higher-education institution in France.'Paris 7 has expressed great interest in the Korean independence movement that shares ideologies and spirit with the French Revolution,' Kim Do-hyung, a senior researcher at the IHK, told The Korea Times. 'We decided to open the course after many French students also showed a deep interest in the exhibitions about the topic from the international symposium held in France last year to commemorate 130 years of Korean-French ties.'Since its launch in 1987, the IHK has promoted how Korea's independence movement against Japanese colonization contributed to world peace.The course is a landmark achievement for the IHK, which wanted to launch the class at the prestigious French university to celebrate its 30th anniversary this year.The IHK is working with the university on collecting and translating historical records necessary for the course.

THE KOREA HERALD August 9, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 9, 2017 Wednesday?Organica hopes to spark a food revolution? LENGTH: 698 wordsConsumers today are bombarded each waking moment with advertisements. Every day, there is a new product that proclaims to be bigger and faster than the last. Weighed down by what has been dubbed ??ad fatigue,?? consumers are now seeking something more -- true value behind products and principled actions by brands.This is the secret behind the rapid growth of Herald Corp.??s premium food brand Organica, according to the group??s Chairman Jungwook Hong. ??I believe the soul of a company lies not in its profits but in its values. If we keep true to our values, growth and profits will follow,?? he said in an interview with The Korea Herald.??The future of humanity and the planet depends on our diets. I founded Organica because I wanted to launch a food revolution in Korea - to change the world through organic, healthy and natural foods.??Organica was established in 2013 as the first company in Korea to offer cold-pressed cleanse juices. Although these types of cold-pressed juices have become relatively common today, the market was virtually nonexistent before Organica was created. Hong says that he was inspired to bring the detox juice trend to Korea after tasting cold-pressed juice overseas in 2012.??In Korea, there were only ??fake juices?? artificially flavored with sugar and additives or ??dead juices?? made with puree or concentrates,?? he said. Under the direction of raw food specialist Christine Cho, the first line of Just Juice was born. Just Juice products are made by pressing fresh fruits and vegetables without adding any sugar or water, and sanitized with high pressure instead of boiling. The juices come in an array of flavors that mix together different fruits and vegetables to produce the best combinations of flavors and nutrients. Organica is aiming for 120 billion won ($106 million) in sales this year, up from 800 million won in 2013 -- a 150-fold rise in just four years. Today, Organica products can be found in major distribution channels including cafe chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean as well as supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores.Following what Hong calls the ??Organica Standard,?? the company has quickly expanded its product range to include all-natural snacks, organic produce, and premium salads and lunch boxes. The variety in Organica??s products, from full meal replacements to detox programs and light snacks, allows consumers to incorporate organic and natural foods into all parts of their diet.The Organica Standard includes seven guidelines in the development of products -- to minimize processing, eliminate artificial flavoring and colors, reduce sugar and sodium, encourage the use of plant-based ingredients, and maximize the use of environmentally friendly produce. It also supports ethical market practices and fair trade, and seeks to minimize food and other wastes.Hong himself strives to follow a clean diet. The goal is to live not only a healthier life, but also one that respects the environment and animal life.??The main reason I have stopped eating meat is because of the impact of meat production on the environment and animal lives. In fact, meat production emits more greenhouse gases than all the world??s transportation systems combined and is a main cause of environmental destruction and climate change,?? he said.?To do its part in supporting organizations that share its vision of protecting the environment, Organica has continuously made contributions to the World Wide Fund for Nature.Hong says that he will continue to aggressively pursue growth as long as it remains in line with Organica??s core philosophy. In the past four years Organica has made numerous acquisitions to fuel its expansion including an eco-friendly grains company, an organic produce company and a lunch box company. Organica has also acquired CJ CheilJedang??s Anseong manufacturing plant in Gyeonggi Province. The company operates production centers in Anseong, Gimpo, Chungju and Gwangju. ??The most important goal is to maintain the principles of natural foods and turn Organica into the dominant natural food brand in Asia based on such principles,?? Hong said.

Accordingly, an increasing number of people are seeking work after retirement.The thought of linking the demand for work and the possible supply of jobs occurred to one of the founders of the new company, Cho Yong-min, while he was serving his military duty at a welfare center for senior citizens in Seoul.'He saw that many senior citizens were not doing much, yet believed in the value they could create,' Jenny Cho, another founder, said in an interview with The Korea Times.At the time, Cho was a student at Princeton. He reached out to a professor at his school, and as a result, he connected seniors in Korea with students taking Korean language classes at Princeton through an online platform.The exchanges were later offered for students at Yale as well.After several years of experimenting, the social volunteer project developed into a business.SAYIn January, the two Chos and Quan Nguyen founded SAY, a platform through which Korean senior citizens teach students Korean.SAY now has 22 instructors and has sold over 1,000 lessons in the past year.Seventy-five percent of its teachers are aged 50 and above. They are retired professionals with backgrounds in the corporate sector as well as education.'We value empowering seniors,' Nguyen said.'Korea is one of the fastest aging societies in the world and many seniors are retiring and in need of jobs. We felt this was a great place to step in.'SAY got started with funding from personal care product company Yuhan-Kimberly, which is involved in projects for senior citizens, and from the Seoul Metropolitan Government's 50 Plus Foundation.Among its students 40 percent are based in Korea and 60 percent abroad _ including the U.S., Singapore, China and Japan.'Many students based abroad want to learn Korean for career reasons, while for others it is due to an interest in Korean pop culture, or because they have a Korean spouse,' Nguyen said.Students in Korea are mostly English-language instructors.With help from an instructor at Yonsei University's Foreign Language Institute, the founders developed SAY's own curriculum _ which offers conversation-based classes ranging from levels one to five. Students taking level five classes are able to discuss issues such as North Korea's nuclear threats.Nguyen, who has passed the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK) II's 4th grade, took some of the classes earlier to improve his Korean.Nguyen, who is from the U.S., had no ties to Korea but started learning the language in a class he took when he was a university student.'My mom used to watch K-dramas and my college friends were listening to K-pop,' Nguyen recalled.After he started learning Korean, he developed a greater interest in Korea, which prompted him to come to Seoul on a one-year exchange program.Nguyen's experience in Korea brought him back, this time for work. He recently earned a visa for residency.Win-win strategySAY benefits not only senior citizens in providing them jobs but also students, the founders said.'Previously we hired college students as teachers _ but we found they were busy with their studies and many left in search of better jobs,' Cho said.'However, senior citizens have the time to teach and can also offer students more with the richer life experiences they have.'SAY does not require its instructors to hold licenses to teach Korean, but subjects the applicants to rigorous training under a program it has developed.According to SAY, 98 percent of its students rated the courses five out of five in their evaluations. Seventy percent of them come back and take more courses.'It is our social mission to connect generations,' Cho said _ and this is what SAY stands for _ Seniors and Youth.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: AGING (91%); SENIOR CITIZENS (91%); OLDER WORKERS (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); AGING TRENDS (90%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (89%); SENIOR CENTERS & CLUBS (78%); LANGUAGE SCHOOLS (78%); RETIREMENT & RETIREES (78%); POPULATION GROWTH (77%); CURRICULA (77%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (77%); EMPLOYMENT SEARCH (75%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); VOLUNTEERS (70%); INTERVIEWS (67%); CITIES (50%); CITY GOVERNMENT (50%); PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS (50%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (99%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%); JAPAN (72%)LOAD-DATE: December 21, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Only English and Korean history tests are scored on absolute grading scales.The ministry had presented two revision proposals in early August. The first option is to adopt the absolute grading for only four subjects ? including English, Korean history, social sciences and a second foreign language. The second one is to adopt an absolute grading for all subjects.The ministry was initially going to announce a final decision on Aug. 31. But due to lack of time in establishing national consensus, the ministry said last week that it would delay the revision by a year.The popular President Moon Jae-in has ranked low on education policy. This is mainly because Kim, in pursuit of 'fair education,' has been pushing for radical changes to public education and college admission without properly considering the students and parents' perspectives.For them, the main problem is not how the CSAT is graded. The absolute grading system may not have the desired effect of reducing the burden of private education. Rather, many are concerned that they will have to focus more on preparing for other critical references for university admission, such as academic records, because universities are expected to place less importance on the CSAT in picking students after the expansion of an absolute grading system.What the students want most is not changing the CSAT grading system, but simplifying college admission procedures so the students do not have to study for so many subjects and spend too much time and money on boosting their academic records while also studying for the CSAT. Their voices need to be reflected in any changes to college admission policy.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); ACADEMIC ADMISSIONS (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); GRADES & GRADING (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (77%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (73%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (73%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (71%); PRIME MINISTERS (57%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: September 4, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Without hesitating, she admits the weekly romanticized portrayals of Korean life '100 percent' influenced her decision to come.'It still doesn't feel real,' she said. 'Coming here was crazy, one of the biggest things I wished for actually happened.' After completing a yearlong language course and now almost halfway through her first year of economics at Sungkyunkwan University, she has settled in Korea. But her earlier adjustment period proved that life here would resemble very little of a Korean drama series. As a Muslim, she said she was 'heartbrokenï'to find that every food she wanted to try seemed to contain pork and was initially shocked by the amount of people smoking, as well as how short shorts could be. But it was she called 'the staring thingï'that made her life difficult at first. 'When I first came here that was the first time I left my country and I was just 17 so with people staring at me it was hard. I felt like everyone was looking at me and I walked with my head down and I wouldn't ride the subway alone because I was uncomfortable,ï'she said. However, she soon found her 'first family in Koreaï'in Salam Nuri, a community of Muslims from Korea and around the world who aim to share the culture and traditions of Islam with those who are interested. The group was formed in 2012 to reach out to the growing Muslim community here, which now stands at an estimated 140,000. The organization holds fundraising events as well as seminars, workshops and Arabic classes that are all open to the public. On top of university and a part-time job, Hussaina volunteers as the group's media manager. She was introduced to the organization by Safa Lamia Ahmed, a physics student at Ewha Womans University from Bangladesh. For Safa, the organization serves as a home away from home. 'Outside of school I wouldn't really say I have really close friends at university. My closest friends in Korea are from Salam Nuri or from my first year (here) during the language classes,ï'she said.Safa's life in Seoul is a far cry from her first year here in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, where she studied Korean in 2013. She says her appearance was often met with shocked responses, as the area didn't have a big foreign population. Faced with daily stares and questions about her hijab, she replied with a smile and used the opportunity to practice her language skills. She soon found the local community warmed to her. 'I think Korean people don't have much knowledge about Muslims. The thing you don't have knowledge about, you're scared of, right?ï'she said.The 24-year-old, who is also a volunteer with Salam Nuri, uses her role in the group as an opportunity to combat the prejudice Muslims in Korea face, which she says usually focuses on terrorism -- an association that has cost her jobs.After being called for an interview as an English teacher, she was asked to send a photograph by the recruiter. 'I sent it and he said, 'OK wait.ï'Before coming to the interview he called me and asked if I could remove my hijab.ï'When she declined she was told not to come to the interview. The recruiter apologized saying that 'people would be scared.ï''I wasn't really surprised, but it felt bad that it wasn't because I didn't have the ability to teach, it was because of my hijab,ï'she said. After the incident, Safa stopped applying for jobs. She currently works at a Korean Halal restaurant near the mosque in Itaewon, which is owned by one of the leaders of Salam Nuri. Hussaina, who works at the same restaurant, said she did not apply for jobs because it is harder to get work outside the university if you wear a hijab.While a university might be more diverse in its hiring practices, having a convenient place to pray on campus can be a struggle for some. After clearing it with the professor overseeing international students at her university, Safa was given the green light to pray in a multipurpose room in the science building where she spends most of her day. However, she arrived one day to find 'Muslims no trespassingï'written on the whiteboard there. While the sign was erased, she said she felt unwelcome and usually uses what empty space she can find instead. Ewha Womans University stated it provides Multicultural Meditation Rooms in two student dormitories -- on opposite sides of the campus -- which Muslims are welcome to use for prayer. Given that it is a Christian school, however, a lot of prayer rooms are for Christians. However, the university said it has not received complaints or any expressions of discontent from Muslims at Ewha or from any group regarding the use of prayer rooms.While Safa says any bad experiences she has had here are exceptions rather than the rule, she hopes Koreans will become more open to learning about her religion beyond what is shown in the media. With the government announcing earlier this year plans to expand the number of Muslim-friendly restaurants and with Lotte opening a designated prayer room for Muslims in its Jamsil department store, one might conclude that Korea is showing strides toward change -- even if for tourism purposes. However, Korea's representation of Muslims has recently come under fire. Earlier this year, MBC drama 'Man who Dies to Liveï'was criticized for its insensitive portrayal of Islam and Arabs, including women in bikinis wearing hijabs with an advertisement saying 'buy one princess, get two free.'As Korea becomes more globalized, Hussaina hopes it will open its doors more to Muslim society -- if anything, to better the lives of Korean Muslims here. 'This is their society, we can always go back to our country, but they only have Korea. For them to live, eat and work here is more challenging because the moment they put on the hijab they also find it difficult to (find) work and they also receive discrimination from fellow Koreans,ï'she said.By Anita McKay (anita@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: RELIGION (91%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (90%); PRESS RELEASES (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (89%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); FUNDRAISING (78%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (71%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NIGERIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: September 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Forney, the evacuation control officer.'South Korea remembers the sacrifice you and your ancestors made. We will forever remember the memory of gratitude and respect,' the President said in a commemorative speech. 'The South Korea-U.S. alliance was formed through blood, not through signatures on papers. It is also strongly linked to the life of the citizens of the two nations.'He said the American and U.N. soldiers' fight made the Hungnam Evacuation happen, in which U.S. soldiers abandoned their weapons to carry more civilians. About 14,000 people survived because of the operation, including Moon's parents. 'Without the soldiers and without the evacuation, I wouldn't be here,' he said. 'Beyond my own family history, I'm deeply touched at the soldiers' love for humanity as they did not withdraw by themselves but evacuated that many refugees from North Korea.'Moon planted a hawthorn there, which is also called Winter King, 'to remember the Chosin Battle where the heroic soldiers fought in the bitter cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius.''As this tree grows, the South Korea-U.S. alliance will grow further. It will bear fruitful results of a unified Korean Peninsula,' he said.In response, Neller expressed his gratitude to Moon for coming to commemorate the war veterans.

"335","Oscar buzz",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"March","Oscar buzz  Korea Times March 5, 2017 Sunday   Korea TimesMarch 5, 2017 SundayOscar buzzBYLINE: By Monday morning, of course, the buzz was all about whom to blame for the best picture envelope mix-up, and, in the right-wing media, whether Beatty, a staunch liberal, had been made to look like a fool.LENGTH: 632 wordsHollywood might buzz forever about that best picture flub at the end of the Academy Awards on Sunday. Pity Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and PricewaterhouseCoopers: From now on, no awards montage will be complete without their fabulous, erroneous announcement that the Oscar would go to ""La La Land."" Which it did not.But out here in the culture, where show business and art still influence and reflect us, there were other, perhaps more telling takeaways from the red carpet.One was the way the evening kept circling back to essential questions about truth and inclusion. In ways that went far beyond studio A-lists, that's what concerned us: whose perspectives, whose truths and voices, would be in, and whose would be out.Would the entertainment industry - so egalitarian in its ideals, so relentlessly white and male in its power structure - finally, meaningfully recognize diverse talent and stories? Or would this be another #OscarsSoWhite?Would the evening celebrate the global reach of entertainment, or would it appease those demanding some canned, ""nationalist"" definition of American culture?Would the Hollywood left deliver yet another hours-long ordeal of liberal speeches alienating and excluding the conservative half of the country? Or would someone - anyone - consider art's power to bring people together?These cliffhangers are America's truth at the moment. Credit the entertainment industry for letting them surface. And for answering at least some of them fairly and well, if just for an evening.The awards were, as it turned out, more diverse than in years past, a symbolic thing, maybe, but immeasurably important to those whose voices have long been marginalized in this culture. The appreciation wasn't just token, either: The supporting actor performances of Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali were deservedly acclaimed.The real best picture - ""Moonlight"" - was not just universal in its humanity, but quietly persuasive: In an era of white, straight, male oligarchs blustering vapidly about ""taking back"" the country, the academy celebrated the coming of age of a black child in a poor, homophobic community.The awards also spoke intelligently to this nation's international role, never mind the isolationist policies of President Donald Trump's administration. The absence of Iranian director and foreign film winner Asghar Farhadi shone a meaningful spotlight on Trump's disgraceful travel ban.And even the celebrity speeches seemed to have evolved some. Yes, there were the inevitable lapel ribbons - blue, this year, in support of the American Civil Liberties Union - and yes, the host, Jimmy Kimmel, tweeted at Trump midway through the proceedings and noted in his monologue that hundreds of countries ""now hate us.""But anyone expecting a moment like, say, the one in 2003 when Michael Moore was booed for assailing George W. Bush's Iraq invasion, or 1973, when Marlon Brando weirdly sent the Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his best actor Oscar, was sorely disappointed.Whether by strategy or just out of fear of losing the 44 percent of Americans who like the job Trump is doing so far, Hollywood didn't deliver the Oscar-night president bashing most of the nation expected. Few, in fact, even named the president directly. Hooray for them.We're better than that, even in show biz. There was generosity and grace in the way the ""La La Land"" people yielded ""Moonlight's"" well-deserved Oscar, and in Kimmel's suggestion that the rest of us find someone with whom we disagree, and ""have a positive, considerate conversation, not as liberals or conservatives but as Americans.""""It starts with us,"" Kimmel suggested.

"336","Hiroshima launches origami against nuclear missiles",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"October","Hiroshima launches origami against nuclear missiles  Korea Times October 11, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesOctober 11, 2017 WednesdayHiroshima launches origami against nuclear missilesBYLINE: By Dr. Chris BaumannLENGTH: 1025 wordsSadako Sasaki's paper cranes are on display at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan. / Courtesy of Dr. Chris Baumann.World should learn lesson of peace, not warHIROSHIMA, Japan - 'Where is the war memorial?' I asked at my hotel last month. 'You mean the Peace Memorial Park?' was the response. In a split second I learned my lesson: It is about peace, not war, and Hiroshima has a profound understanding of this lesson.In 1945, 150,000 people perished as a result of the first dropping of an atomic bomb; 10 percent of them were Korean. Many more had their lives destroyed by losing family and friends, or developing cruel illnesses from the massive radiation - their bodies and offspring malformed.Sadako Sasaki was only two years old when Enola Gay dropped Little Boy, detonating close to her home in Hiroshima. Initially, she appeared unharmed, but developed leukemia when she was 11. After being told the East Asian legend that folding 1,000 paper cranes would grant her a wish, the terminally ill girl tirelessly folded such in her hospital bed.After the war, even getting a hold of paper was a challenge, so Sadako had to beg for paper scraps and used leftover medicine and gift wrappings. Doctors discouraged her from doing so to preserve energy, but Sadako was on a mission, a mission much larger than she could have imagined during her short life. She passed away in 1955. She was 12 years old.Children's Peace Monument stands at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, Japan.The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in its museum displays a photo of Sadako in her coffin with a peaceful face, not revealing the cruelty that overshadowed that short life. On display is also a selection of Sadako's origami.One could admire them for hours - they resemble the tragedy of war, the cruelty of an A-bomb, yet also display the hope of a young girl. The precision with which these cranes were folded demonstrates Sadako's work ethic, her determination, and her will to heal; not knowing that later in history her origami would contribute to healing on a much larger scale.The dropping of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not least positioned as an experiment, a way to learn about the impact of atomic bombs. Doctors were sent to examine the illnesses developed over time. Cancer and bodily harm were carefully documented.The Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) examined Sadako, but her legacy could not be detected in medical nor postmortem examinations. Her wisdom was beyond her age when she mumbled the following on her deathbed: 'I will write peace on your wings and you will fly all over the world.'The Peace Watch Tower at the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima shows the number of days since the first dropping of the A-bomb as well as the number of days since the latest nuclear test.The Peace Watch Tower at the Peace Memorial Park indicated that the last nuclear explosion was when North Korea conducted its sixth test; only nine days previous to Sept. 12.When I returned to the hotel, the news on TV reported on nuclear testing plans in various parts of the world (East Asia, Russia, the Middle East), accompanied by sharp rhetoric by politicians on such testing and missiles fired into space.Policymakers and politicians have obviously not stayed at 'my' hotel in Hiroshima (it's about peace, not war); nor seen the photo of Sadako in her coffin; not yet touched by her origami; not seen the eyewitness reports of survivors of the A-bomb (e.g. pyjama buttons were literally burned onto the skin of children asleep as they died from the nuclear impact).Tension on the Korean Peninsula is high now; there is turmoil in the Middle East; and the West is making public places and monuments 'terrorist proof' with barricades whereas they used to be open to the people for centuries. Has humanity really learned so little about peace? Alarmingly, it is estimated that nine countries have roughly 15,000 nuclear weapons 'ready to go.'Normally, I contribute articles to The Korea Times on education, performance and competitiveness, and these are important areas to monitor and also 'manage' for any country's institutions. Aspiring global competitiveness is crucial, no doubt.But perhaps a visit to Hiroshima is a wakeup call that on a different dimension, there should also be competitiveness for peace in the world. Nations should aspire to increase their global competitiveness to allow economic prosperity for their citizens.At the same time, there should be intensified efforts to ensure peace, ensure history does not repeat itself with regards to the two world wars - not trigger a third one! - and with regards to using nuclear weapons. The impacts are simply too devastating.The city of Hiroshima has become an advocate for peaceful coexistence in a world where peace is fragile. In 2009, one of Sadako's last origami pieces was donated to a museum in the exact country that dropped the A-bomb; the WTC Visitor Center in New York.The Sasaki family has practically given away all of Sadako's paper cranes; now imaginary origami have to land on the desks of today's politicians and policymakers.Hiroshima has learned the 'peace, not war' lesson, and that legacy is best summarized by my friend and mentor, professor Rosalie L. Tung at Simon Fraser University (SFU), who had also visited Hiroshima: It does remind us of how destructive war is but, at the same time, the resilience of humankind and the ability to rise from the ashes.Sadako's origami have landed on so many school desks (since her story is often part of school curricula), at the WTC Visitor Center, and has certainly landed on my desk. Her legacy is for her cranes to also land on desks in centers of power currently playing with fire; a fire where they understand the ignition process, but not the ashes of the aftermath.Dr. Chris Baumann is an associate professor at Macquarie University, Sydney, and visiting professor at Seoul National University (SNU) in Korea.

"337","[Editorial] Wrong way",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Editorial] Wrong way   THE KOREA HERALD June 26, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 26, 2017 Monday[Editorial] Wrong way LENGTH: 753 wordsIt is not wrong to say there are problems with some of the nation??s elite high schools. It is wrong, however, to shut them down altogether in the name of equality and education reform. A big question is why students -- not only those who currently attend the schools but also those who have been preparing to enter them -- and their parents should go through such confusion due to the short-sighted, politically motivated move. Removing some elite schools from the high school system has been a pet plank of liberal educators and politicians who chant the equality mantra. Their position has been bolstered by the election victory of President Moon Jae-in, who promised to close down some of the elite high schools. Quickly moving to take advantage of the changed political environment, Gyeonggi Province education chief Lee Jae-jung had already announced plans to turn foreign language schools and ??autonomous?? private schools in the province into ordinary ones.Lee specifically said the provincial education office will turn foreign language and autonomous schools into ordinary ones by denying them renewal of licenses that are needed every five years. Cho Hee-yon, another liberal who heads the Seoul Education Office, also indicated he would take the same course of action to get rid of the elite schools in the capital. Their logic is simple: The elite schools are mainly for the children of the ??rich and privileged?? and they put a hierarchy into the high school system. There are 81 foreign language and autonomous private schools across the country. Basically, they charge higher tuition fees -- about three times as much as ordinary schools -- to maintain financial autonomy without government subsidies. By doing this, they enjoy greater freedom than ordinary private and public schools for school operations, including admissions and curricula. Critics argue the schools encourage excessive -- and expensive -- private tutoring for middle school students as they serve as a sort of gateway to prestigious colleges. Indeed, the foreign language and autonomous schools draw the nation??s brightest and occupy the top ranks in the number of students admitted into prestigious colleges. Such problems, however, are something that can be addressed, not something to be exploited only to block elite education. As liberals argue, equality and fairness are very important elements of education. Equally is the pursuit of diversity and excellence, all the more so as we are in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. It is ironic that part of elite high school education -- including the introduction of predecessors of the current autonomous private schools -- was initiated by former President Kim Dae-jung, whose liberal administration laid the basis for the Roh Moo-yun administration and the Moon administration as well. As critics of the elite schools insist, there may be some gaps -- including those of academic levels -- between them and other schools. Such gaps exist even among ordinary private and public schools. Another big problem is the way officials push for closing down the elite schools is hardly educational or democratic. As Oh Se-mok, principal of Joongdong High School, an autonomous private school in Seoul, noted, neither the central government nor the Seoul Education Office contacted the schools before making such an important policy decision.It was right for Oh, who heads the association of autonomous private high schools, to criticize in a news conference last week the education authorities for pushing for what he called a ??populist policy?? in a ??dictatorial?? way. It is not easy for a principal of a school that is regulated and supervised by officials to stand up to them in such a courageous manner, especially at a time when a new government is flexing its muscles in the name of reform. That testifies to the gravity of the issue. Principals like Oh and parents of students at the elite schools have been organizing themselves to oppose the plan to shut them down. The confrontation between education authorities and the principals and parents will reach it peak this week as Cho, the Seoul superintendent, plans to announce whether he plans to renew licenses of five schools Wednesday. Education should be insulated from politics, and the pursuit of excellence in education cannot be compromised. The campaign to preserve foreign language and autonomous high schools should be cheered on. Filing litigation against education authorities could be one way to fight.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: SECONDARY SCHOOLS (91%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); LIBERALISM (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (90%); CHILDREN (89%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (89%); EDUCATION REFORM (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS (78%); TUITION FEES (78%); LANGUAGE SCHOOLS (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); CURRICULA (78%); POLITICS (76%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (73%); ACADEMIC ADMISSIONS (73%); PUBLIC FINANCE (69%); RANKINGS (62%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIES (53%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 26, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"338","Ghent University focuses on value of life",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Ghent University focuses on value of life  Korea Times January 18, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesJanuary 18, 2017 WednesdayGhent University focuses on value of lifeBYLINE: By Oh Gun-hakLENGTH: 656 wordsOver the years, I have faced choices that would determine my future. Some came a few times, giving me a chance to reconsider my decisions, while others forked in directions that would I never meet again.Deciding to go to Ghent University was one of those choices that indelibly marked my future.To be honest, I once questioned myself over whether applying to Ghent was the right decision and feared that I had set foot on a path that had no turning back. However, as I spent more time there, I realized that going to Ghent University was one of the best decisions I had ever made.When the time came to start considering which university to go, I was torn.Having attended an international school, I certainly preferred English over Korean and found Western culture more comfortable. Yet, there was part of me that wanted to go to a Korean university, which could give more clarification to my identity.However, for some reason, I was irresistibly drawn to Ghent University.Ghent University Global Campus (GUGC) is a Belgian university that resides in Incheon Global Campus in Korea, along with other universities such as George Mason, Stony Brooks, and Utah University.Unlike the main campus in Belgium, all of the curricula on the global campus are offered in English. Upon discovering this, I knew right away that this was an opportunity that I could not miss.When I applied to the GUGC, the admissions office warned me about the rigorous science programs. At that time, I was suspicious about the 'rigorous' curricula. Had I heeded those words, I might have at least been prepared for the all-nighters. Every day, classes started at 8 a.m., and ended at around 5 p.m. with a short lunch time in the middle. After dinner, I would meet my friends to review what was covered in class.Life in college was so different from what I thought it would be like. I doubted myself and was sure that I would not make it through. Fortunately, I found my first year not only meaningful, but also enjoyable thanks to my professors.In Ghent University, professors have great passion for both science and their students. Subjects that I once thought were boring and incomprehensible became my favorites as my professors revealed the beauty of each subject.One aspect of Ghent University that enticed me was its vision: 'Life on earth is humanity's most precious resource and should be managed responsibly.' I unequivocally agree.Even at a young age, I had such a mindset, which would manifest even in small matters such as not killing insects. But, that developed into more sophisticated concerns about harm inflicted on the environment by human beings, such as the irresponsible use of technology or negligence toward the endangerment of some species. I've always felt the urgency of this crisis.Sometimes it was so difficult that I'd try to convince those around me. An eye roll and a playful tease was usually what I got. I don't blame them, because I must have sounded like a deranged lunatic. Yet, when I heard about Ghent University, I saw it as an opportunity to make a difference in the world by preserving and improving the most valuable resource that humanity had received.As hinted earlier, Ghent University has an intensive curriculum. It is definitely an excellent academic environment that prepares young students for the path they have set foot on.Though it demands hard work and persistence, life in Ghent University became delightful, especially because of the supporting professors. As for me, I am certain that the knowledge and the passion this university has been imparting on me will make me an outstanding environmental scientist. I still see a long path before me, but what motivates me is the desire, nurtured by Ghent University, to preserve what was entrusted to humankind, and perhaps even to turn our attention to something much greater than us.The writer is a sophomore at Ghent University Global Campus in Songdo, Incheon.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); CURRICULA (89%); LIFE FORMS (85%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (67%)CITY: INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (56%)COUNTRY: BELGIUM (91%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 18, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Instead, it needs to highlight some of the problems the country has, then stress to the private sector that it needs to fix them.'The most important task would be to create a business environment through policies where companies can freely invest and workers can flexibly work, Yoo added.Hyung also said the government cannot do everything on its own, adding that there are things it can do like intervene in the market, and things it cannot do like create jobs.Hyung agrees with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party and Yoo Seong-min of the Bareun Party that the private sector, not the government, should lead in creating jobs.The roundtable participants believe Moon's pledge to create 810,000 jobs in the public sector is unfeasible and undesirable.'Over the past 10 years, we saw former governments intervening in the market too much to do everything. The new government needs to make a choice and focus on what it can do for the economy,' said Hyung, formerly a standing commissioner at the Korea Communications Commission.Sung said Moon's job creation in the public sector would not help boost the economy because in response to the measure, people would reduce their consumption due to concerns on future tax hikes. It is the classic economic tenet of the Ricardian Equivalence theorem, he said.But the roundtable participants said the Moon government needs to intervene and tackle inequality, poverty, labor inflexibility and low incomes by increasing fiscal spending.'It needs to improve the country's labor market to help increase workers' disposable income,' Sung said.'Moon's proposal for increasing fiscal spending by 7 percent annually should support the private sector in preparing for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.'The economist suggested raising taxes on gains in the private sector's financial resources and assets, in addition to on high-income earners, to finance its welfare for the elderly and low-income citizens.Korea only spends about 10 percent of its GDP on social welfare, well below the OECD average of 21 percent.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); TAXES & TAXATION (90%); JOB CREATION (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (84%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (77%); ECONOMIC POLICY (75%); TAX RELIEF (73%); BUSINESS CLIMATE & CONDITIONS (73%); SMALL BUSINESS (72%); POLITICAL PARTIES (68%)ORGANIZATION: NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (57%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (93%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (79%); FRANCE (77%)LOAD-DATE: May 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The bars and restaurants in his pictures are like spaces from another planet.The Korea Times spoke with Cossrow about his work and inspiration on the opening night of his exhibition.Q: How would you describe your art?A: The art is an illustrated documentation of Itaewon, through the lens of a distorted fantasy. The art is a journal, without the words. I live and work in Itaewon. I'm from the U.S., so I find beauty in the detail.Q: When did you decide to expand on this style?A: It all began as a journal, both writing and drawing experiences here. Slowly, more detail and visual expression began to take over the writing.Q: What themes do you like to explore?A: I enjoy the nightlife and the characters of Itaewon, so they are the subjects I most enjoy to explore. I have a strange imagination and have always enjoyed fantasy, everything medieval, so those elements also appear in my work. Seoul Pub is a great example of the energy and people. Mildly dark with a long history.Q: Do other artists influence you?A: I'm inspired by a million artists, most who have strong visual and illustrative skills.Q: Do you have any future projects? If yes, what? If no, why not?A: As life moves forward, other people, places and influences will be explored in the illustrative documentation.To get to Living Room, leave exit 2 of Noksapyeong Station.

THE KOREA HERALD September 6, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday[Jay Ambrose] China to the rescue? LENGTH: 651 wordsIt??s China to the rescue, or, if not, the world could be headed for an eventual nuclear holocaust. Irresponsible very nearly to the point of evil, China has been reluctant to do what??s necessary to get North Korea to end its weaponry madness. Not acting decisively now would amount to a curse on humanity.What we??ve recently seen, as everyone knows, is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un exploding what seems a thermonuclear device capable of destroying a major city. It was many times as powerful as other bombs the country had previously tested and a worse nightmare than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It comes after North Korea flew a ballistic missile over northern Japan and tells us of reality catching up with frightening braggadocio.If Kim doesn??t back up, he could very well blast an enemy someday or share technology or even develop weapons with Iran and other beasts in the woods. In response, Japan and South Korea will likely develop nuclear weapons. The world will be in a state worse than the Cold War because predictability will be less certain. And with more and more actors capable of pulling the trigger, proliferation will breed increased likelihood of catastrophe.Discouragingly, however, it seems close to certain Kim will not back up under almost any circumstances. As experts have explained, he sees his regime disappearing short of becoming a nuclear power and he has already shown his personal determination for unceasing power by murdering family and friends.A pre-emptive war, then?That would almost certainly mean millions of South Koreans killed almost immediately, and one thing President Donald Trump should never have done was publicly accuse South Korea of appeasement.He might be more hesitant about that and his trade threats if millions of Americans faced death, and, in fact, South Korea has lately been engaged in military exercises meant to send a message. It has also said it would agree to defensive missiles China does not want it to have. We need to stick close to both South Korea and Japan, which itself has been unflinching in its fierce reactions.Then there??s the possibility of sanctions to bring North Korea to some kind of understanding. The probability of that working is both nil and very good.Sanctions of the usual kind, a billion dollar hurt here and another hurt there, would likely accomplish nothing. Yet, if China ended all trade with North Korea, that could do the job. It??s not that North Korea would change its mind, just that it would no longer be able to sustain its program or maybe even Kim as dictator. China represents 90 percent of all trade with North Korea, and what??s the reclusive country going to accomplish without oil, with no food to feed its people, with no means for anything much?The story is that China won??t do it because a consequent collapse of the regime could well mean a South Korean takeover and China does not want a Western-allied, democratic nation on its border. It also does not want North Koreans streaming into China by way of escape in the early going.Here is what the United States could do and Trump has talked of doing: Don??t trade with anyone who trades with North Korea. That would hurt China enormously but would also hurt us as a way of substituting economic shrinkage for economic growth. It could also breed enmity without simple resolution.The American need is courage along with wisdom and commitment, and we seem to have those in Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H.R.

As the president of South Korea's main ally, these were very irresponsible claims.'Kim's disapproval of Trump not only stemmed from his North Korean rhetoric but also his general view on human rights issues.Regarding this, Kim expressed his frustration with Korean politicians.'It doesn't make sense for them to greet Trump without criticizing the discriminatory remarks he has made against women and racial minorities,' Kim said.And when Kim came to Gwanghwamun Square on Tuesday, he was upset by the new scenery of the square, surrounded by a wired fence and police bus barricades.Pointing to the wire fence, Kim said, 'President Moon Jae-in has referred to himself as the candlelit president, but now his government is obstructing us from freely expressing ourselves, a basic human right provided under the constitution. I'm very disappointed.'The main alliance against Trump which Kim is a part of consists of over 200 liberal civic organizations.And while the members were unified in their efforts to preserve peace and keep war out of the Korean peninsula, they were not exactly together when it came to Trump.'I don't oppose Trump's visit, but more so his rhetoric against North Korea - he has spewed incendiary words against North Korea and about war,' 62-year old Yeo In-cheol who leads the preparatory committee for the Peace Treaty Action Solidarity said.'Our organization was not formed to oppose Trump, but to oppose war. We are a group in pursuit of peace and we are calling for a peace treaty between the U.S. and North Korea,' Yeo continued. 'A war with just conventional arms would be catastrophic - skyscrapers, apartments would collapse, and cause great loss of life. If nuclear war were to break out, Korea would no longer be a place where humanity could live. Not only that, it could spread to include China and Russia, essentially becoming a third world war.'With this in mind, Yeo and his group plans to continue promoting peace in Korea.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW (88%); KOREAN WAR (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); HUMAN RIGHTS (73%); MINORITY GROUPS (68%); LIBERALISM (68%); RACE & ETHNICITY (67%); PEACE PROCESS (64%); CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS (63%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (60%); EMERGENCY VEHICLES (51%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (92%); MOON JAE-IN (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (50%)LOAD-DATE: November 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Korea Times February 20, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesFebruary 20, 2017 MondayWhy do pro-Park activists wave US, Israeli flags?BYLINE: By Yi Whan-wooLENGTH: 395 wordsControversy is brewing over the use of U.S. and Israeli flags by supporters of the impeached President Park Geun-hye during their weekend rallies that have nothing to do with the countries.Right-wing groups have organized these rallies to counter much-larger demonstrations demanding Park's removal from power by the Constitutional Court.Pro-Park counterprotesters have waved the Korean national flag, or Taegeukgi, at the rallies, which they call 'Taegeukgi rallies' themselves. Lately, they have also been bringing U.S. and Israeli flags to the political events.The participants claim it is a way to show their 'patriotism,' but criticism is prevalent that the flags are being misused.Several protesters, who are mainly in their 60s or older, have been waving the Korean and U.S. flags together in a bid to underscore the Korea-U.S. security alliance against 'North Korean sympathizers.'Some others, who call themselves devout churchgoers, have brought the Israeli flag with a wooden cross and other symbols they think can represent their faith.But critics said Monday that such expressions may only stir up misunderstandings toward the U.S and Israel as well as Christianity.The U.S. and Israeli embassies in Seoul were not available for comment.The National Christian Council in Korea (NCCK), a group of protestant congregations here, asked its believers to refrain from taking part in events organized by extremists.'The council was astonished by some of its members, including pastors, taking leading roles in collaborating with far-right activists,' the NCCK said in a statement. 'The members should not idolize unjust power and disgrace God's name.'It also asked its radical members to repent, citing that they have been chanting for 'declaration of martial law and rise of the armed forces against the rebels.'Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University, warned against politicizing religion.'I don't think the U.S. and Israeli governments will find it too serious but using foreign flags for a political event may cause unnecessary debate, especially when such event is politicizing a religion,' he said.A Daum user with ID Clean Society posted, 'The pro-Park Geun-hye forces are ruining the values of the Korean flag, conservatism and patriotism.'A different Daum user with ID ojh suggested banning the use of Korean flags by Park's supporters.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); RELIGION (90%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (90%); POLITICS (89%); IMPEACHMENT (78%); CONSERVATISM (77%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (72%); PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM (72%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (70%); MARTIAL LAW (67%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (67%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (93%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: ISRAEL (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: February 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Pazyrik refers to a Scythian Iron Age archaeological culture that existed between the 6th and 3rd century BC. It was conducted to research the correlation between the stone tombs of the Altai Mountains region and those found in Korea, and was jointly carried out by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage and Institute of Archaeology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences.The excavated mummy was about 165-170 centimeters tall and was presumed to be from the 1st century AD. The garments were the style that was in fashion in China during that era. As the Chinese kingdoms during the era were mostly confined to what is now central regions of China, officials at NRICH said that the dig strongly indicates that the region was a hub for cultural exchange between the East and West during that era. 'It is yet unclear if the male mummy was a merchant travelling along the Silk Road, or was related to the mass migration during the transition period of Qin dynasty and Han dynasty. Additional scientific analysis must take place,ï'officials from the NRICH said, vowing more research on the culture exchange in the Eurasian region of the ancient times.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARCHAEOLOGY (92%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (91%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (91%); ANCIENT HISTORY (90%); MOUNTAINS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (75%)STATE: CENTRAL CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: MONGOLIA (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); CHINA (92%)LOAD-DATE: October 16, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"348","On Forty Steps",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"July","On Forty Steps  Korea Times July 18, 2017 Tuesday   Korea TimesJuly 18, 2017 TuesdayOn Forty StepsBYLINE: By Bernard RowanLENGTH: 701 wordsBusan may be South Korea's second city, but it includes a monument central to the history of present-day Korea. I'm talking about the Forty Steps Stairway in Jungang neighborhood. Don't overlook this deceptively simple space and place. I think it's a symbol of the past and the way forward for Korea. That means a future of peace and eventual reunification.During the Korean War, the new Republic struggled. The Chinese Army and the North pushed the U.S.-ROK forces all the way to Busan. Many Korean people in the South lived around the Forty Steps area, originally a Japanese residential area. Lives were at risk. The War divided families. In the tumult, loved ones lost one another.In turn, the stairs stood as a finding place. People knew to go there and look for loved ones. In the area grew a marketplace for Koreans to buy and sell goods. Nearby humble homes cropped up -- a grim place at a grim time. Yet, the stairs were a place of hope.The Forty Steps enabled reunifying Korean families who had lost one another. It also stands today as a monument to those horrible times of war, suffering, injury, death, and dislocation. A deep basis for han, the steps also bridge to a possible happiness and peace.Today the steps form one site in a cultural district created by the municipal authority in the 1990s. Simple, rugged sculptures depict various characters and scenes of life then. Enjoy the many works of art, restaurants and shops in the area. Also stop to climb or descend the steps. A sculpture of a man playing an accordion rests midway. From the Life in Korea webpage, I've read the song 'Gyeongsang-do Lady' plays nearby.At the top of the steps is a memorial display in the Donggwang Dong office building. Next time I visit, I want to see the Forty Steps Memorial Hall located there.What's this mediating accordionist? His music waits in time, awaiting the rebirth of a Korean peninsula at peace. No more armistice. No more weapons of mass destruction. No more separation of North and South. No more power rivalries and constellations of allies and competitors? Will his real brother ever find the steps to reunite with this statue and bring it to life?The song, Arirang, also came to mind when I visited this place. Someone should write a version that focuses on Forty Steps Stairway. Like the lyrics of this perhaps most famous Korean folk song, the steps represent a passage. They mark a way from past to future among people who love one another, a dream or myth or hope for two beloveds to unite again in future. The Forty Steps meant a place for loved ones to meet again for many people. They still mean that for Korean leaders and families divided North and South, and for the divided countries themselves. I'm going to tell you that a cousin to this song is the famous hymn, 'Shall We Gather at The River'.One day the leaders of a unified Korea will meet in this place, I hope. I hope they'll call for erecting another district, cultural symbols, and museum to the fruition of this place's solemn yet open and inviting call.When I visited this place with my Korean friend's son, we stood at the base of these steps for a few pictures. When I later viewed the pictures, a young girl was sitting by the accordion player midway up the steps gesturing with two 'V's', which is a sign of peace. At the nearby Korean railway station is the Gate of Peace, a beautiful expectation of the future in our hopes and hearts.The Forty Steps mark a bridge for many people. This place reminds us of the need to bring together the divided. This fundamental tendency in humanity is neither our only tendency nor perhaps the major human drive. Yet, the Forty Steps calmly and perennially calls on the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the entire world to deal with and honor the memory and sufferings of the Korean people. The Forty Steps represent life, which is a fundamental human purpose, and my dear Korea, may we never forget it!Bernard Rowan is associate provost for contract administration and professor of political science at ChicagoStateUniversity.

However, the government is pushing ahead with its plan for schools to use the textbook on a voluntary basis.The education ministry had invited schools to take part in a pilot project this year to use the textbooks, but received the cold shoulder from education offices and schools.Yet Seoul Digitech High School's principal Kwak Il-chun said Tuesday the school will be using the state-authored history textbook, the first to agree to do so, according to a report by local newspaper Dong-A Ilbo.The school had been seeking to be designated by the education ministry as a school for the pilot project. But the progressive Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education (SMOE) refused to pass along the ministry's document outlining the pilot project.Six out of 17 regional education offices did not distribute the ministry's document to schools, prompting the ministry to extend the deadline for schools to apply for the pilot program.The school said it will request the textbook from the education ministry.The principal earlier created a stir during the school's ceremony concluding the 2016 academic year, calling President Park Geun-hye's impeachment ruling a 'political conspiracy.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (91%); HISTORY (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); SCHOOL PRINCIPALS (78%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); LIBERALISM (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (73%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (73%); CONSPIRACY (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (95%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (95%)LOAD-DATE: February 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Gosling said he tried to bring out a more human side compared to Rick Deckard, the protagonist in the 1982 movie.K is the new blade runner after Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, who returns after going missing for 30 years.'The former blade runners were much more isolated and dismissed from society,' Gosling said during a media teleconference at CGV Yongsan, Seoul, Monday. 'My character K struggles to find his identity and love and friendship. He tries to overcome hardships in that process.'Blade runners have a mission to hunt down human clones who are out of control. The clones are called 'replicants.' K believes there is a secret involving him and the replicants and turns to Deckard for answers.Ford said he has developed the character Deckard to be deeper and more sophisticated for the sequel.He also said Gosling is a well-prepared actor who likes to challenge himself in new adventures. Gosling responded by praising Ford as the best actor at the moment and said he catches all the important parts of every sequence on screen.The original 'Blade Runner' directed by Ridley Scott questioned the essence of a person through the replicants cloned by humans. The sequel's filmmaker Denis Villeneuve posed a philosophical question of whether a replicant should also be called human in the end. Director Villeneuve left every possible room for the audience to believe Deckard could also be a replicant but did not give specific clues. It is the same in the sequel, he said.'The new episode makes it more suspicious on Deckard's identity as a human being or not and keeps the mystery in the sequel. It is interesting how original fiction that movie is based on shows a human clone question his own identity,' Villeneuve said.Ford agreed finding out the identity of Deckard in 'Blade Runner 2049' is an interesting point to watch for and there is a new story added to gives clue on the mysterious character, which the actor hopes audiences will interpret differently.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FILM (90%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (90%); VISUAL ARTISTS (89%); HUMAN CLONING (89%); CLONING (89%); MOVIE & VIDEO INDUSTRIES (89%); FILM DIRECTORS (78%); INTERNET VIDEO (78%); SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY FILMS (73%)PERSON: RYAN GOSLING (94%); HARRISON FORD (93%)LOAD-DATE: September 19, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

IOT in nascent stage, more to explore: George PopescuGeorge Popescu is the CEO and co-founder of augmented reality tech platform Lampix. He is also the founder and editor in chief of media company Lending Times.Over the past 10 years, he has founded over 10 companies in fields such as the internet, craft beer, sports car rental, journal publishing and investment funds.He holds three master's degrees: a master's in science from MIT where he focused on 3-D printing; a master's in electrical engineering and computer science from Supelec in France; a master's in nanosciences from Paris XI University. Q. Who or what do you think has the power to lead the trend of the global design industry?A. In general I find people who are focused on the future and least conservative lead a given field. For me, design requires a deep understanding of humans, their behavior, their behavioral change, as well as, of course, aesthetics. I think it is the regions of the world that are at the center of the next tech revolutions that will play the big role in this space as well.Q. The Internet-of-Things is at the center of the fourth industrial revolution. What role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A. IoT is an amazing enabler but the main issue I see with it is usability, user experience, installation. It also opens the door to an incredibly large space full of options. I feel that both these directions have not been explored or little explored. The results so far are insufficient to drive real consumer adoption of IoT. Therefore, we are just at the beginning.Q. Is there a memorable Korean design?A. Of course! Who is competing with the American companies and on a world scale from automotives to electronics to household electronics, and more?Q. What drives you to continue to pursue and try new designs?A. Solving issues and not being happy with what we have. Also traveling and seeing/learning. Interactions and diversity. Q. What is a design that gains value over time? A. Simplicity for me is the most valuable force that will make something gain value over time. Also non-fashionable design that cannot be placed in a particular time, year or age, is also the most valuable over time. Q. Over the past 10 years you have founded and operated a slew of companies across various sectors. Why do you repeatedly challenge yourself in new industries? A. I love this question. I love learning new things. Sometimes I do something just because I am curious, because I know nothing about it, and I want to learn. And I love the process through which I learn new things. Especially if it's challenging. So it's curiosity and interest in learning. Perhaps also boredom. I get bored fairly easily.ã€€Q. You are currently the CEO of Lampix, which is not yet well-known in Korea. What does Lampix mean? A. Lampix means Lamp + Pixel. Have you seen the movie 'Minority Reportï'with Tom Cruise? We make a device like in that movie. It's a device that uses the latest technologies like those used in self-driving cars to make any surface 'active and smart.ï'We think of it as a new category of device different to computers and smartphones. The best way to understand it is to watch the videos on our website www.lampix.com. And we launched a crypto token called Pix to help us do 'image miningï'to train our computer vision, the key of the entire system.Q. Many expect augmented-reality technology to greatly impact our lives. What are some pros and cons of AR?A. Augmented reality brings people together and encourages sharing, communication, collaboration, interaction. I think it will be much bigger then VR (VR is for the kind of stuff you do by yourself in your basement). Cons: For the glass type of AR , like Hololense, Google Glass, etc, it is very hard to create content, and to program them. Very complicated. In our case we made Lampix easy to use, program and to create content for. We think easy is the key.Q. The title of your speech for this year's Herald Design Forum is 'Mapping out the 7th sense for humanity.ï'What does it mean?A. In my case it is about including objects in inputs the computers use. Right now, computers have inputs (=senses) that are keyboards, mice, network card, microphones, cameras. However they are not able to sense objects or use pictures/the cameras they use. We are making computers SEE their environment and act on it. Q. When viewing or creating designs, what you value the most?A. Simplicity and intuitiviness Consumers lead design trends: Sung Jung-gi Sung Jung-gi is the creative director and product designer of design company Daylight Asia's headquarters in Seoul. The industrial designer was the first-ever Korean designer of Ideo, a US-based international design and consulting firm, before taking a post at Lunar between 2006 and 2013.The concept hair dryer that sounds like the engine of the Porsche 911 model was recognized by the Porsche Grand Prize. He received the iF Gold award for his design of Elastine shampoo bottles.Q: Who or what do you think has the power to lead trends in the global design industry? ã€€A: I think the consumers, rather than the manufacturers, have the power to lead design trends today. Consumers themselves and the various networks that connect them become platforms that influence the designs. Consumers use, evaluate and share the designs and expand such experiences. In my opinion, this is an era in which consumers have more design power than the designers, who have traditionally been primary (design) manufacturers.Q: What role do you think design will play in the fourth industrial revolution?A: Design should focus more on its original role, which is to create universal value. In recent years, designers have been known to lead the new era by focusing on their own unique values, but I believe design fulfills its true role when it can create universal values. As we came to enjoy many universal values through the first industrial revolution, designs and designers should play a role in a new revolution occurring on the foundation of moral values. My goal as a designer is also to create such universal moral values.Q: Any design or designers from other countries that have left an impression on you?Ideo founder Bill Moggridge and Lunar's design partner Jeff Salazar. One gave me strength to keep designing in my time of hardship, and the other kept watch on me -- from near and from afar -- and made me realize the role of a design and a designer. Q: What is your driving force? What drives you to pursue and try out new designs? A: I always say a designer is a job that requires the thinking and actions of someone aged between a fourth grader and a second year middle school student. To be able to think freely and be relatively free from being held liable for one's actions, to have the mind of a child and to retain the sensitivity of the age when one just begins to contemplate about life, I think these elements are closely linked to whether a designer is able to continuously be creative. For me, being able to retain such behavior is closely related to whether I can keep designing.Q: What is design that gains value over time? A: When a certain phenomenon changes because of a design, that design sticks in my mind. A children's toothbrush that was designed at Ideo is that kind of design. Before, children's toothbrushes were a smaller version of ones for adults. But through observation by Ideo, the new design had much thicker handles than adults', and it changed nearly all the children'sï'toothbrushes from that point on. I believe a successful design is one that creates new value and has a lasting influence on other designs that follow. I make an effort to ensure that my designs carry such values and change behaviors.Q: How do you get a grasp of 'user experienceï'and apply it to your design?ã€€A: I make observations about a person, that person's interaction with a product and the environment from an objective point of view. These observations become an invaluable subject matter in creating a story, which affects the ultimate design.Q: People associate your name with your shampoo bottle design. How did you come up with it?A: This design was created with the aforementioned intent to make the value of a design universal. It says it is for people who cannot see but when you think about it, everyone experiences temporary blindness when they wash their hair. So I made it possible for everyone to be able to distinguish between a shampoo, a conditioner and a hair mask by simply touching it. If my design were exclusively for people with visual impairment, I would be creating another wall. This design's concept is to satisfy everyone, not just certain people. Q: One of the keywords explaining Sung Jung-gi's design is 'humanity.ï'What significance does it have in your design?A: I believe that humanity is essential in all actions of a designer, not just regarding the influence one's design has. As a designer, I believe people should be at the center of all this.Q: As a designer, what kind of design do you pursue?A: The reason I chose Lunar design was because the company allowed me to conduct personal work. I wanted to create designs that can change how the people close to me think and act. Right now, we not only need to manufacture new products, but also create designs that can change how people think and act.I believe that by designing new products and introducing them to the world, we can also introduce new way of thinking, a new way of acting. Mass-producing new thoughts can be the first step. Q: Please tell us about your recent work that left an impression. A: I recently started working at Daylight and had a chance to design baby carriages with people I used to work with at Ideo. This convinced me once again that collaboration in designing is the best way to creating value. I personally believe that designing should be fun in each step of the way. I also believe that a design completed through a relationship based on such fun is more likely to succeed than ones that were not. My past experience taught me that, and this project reassured me. Exciting user experience is guiding principle: Gen TeraoProduct designer Gen Terao is the CEO of Balmuda Inc., which he founded in 2003. Prior to entering the design industry, the award-winning designer pursued a career in music as part of a band until 2001.After the band disbanded, Terao taught himself skills in product design and manufacturing. Balmuda Inc. was first brought to public attention following the launch of Green Fan in 2010. The Balmuda The Toaster toaster-oven, which marks the first product of the company's Hello Kitchen! Series, won the gold prize at the Good Design Awards in 2015. Q. The Internet-of-Things is at the center of the fourth industrial revolution. At this point, what role do you think design plays in the revolution, or what do you think the role of design should be? A. Bridging the gap between our basic pursuit of happiness and ever-changing technology.Q. Is there a memorable Korean design?A. A tool is the most beautiful when it is used and it is in this moment that the tool brings joy to the user. For instance, when I hold an antique Korean teacup in my hand, the beautiful form gives me a deeper appreciation of the taste of the tea. In this sense, I think the stone bibimbap bowl is a superb tool. Q. What is your driving force? A. I have a strong desire to make people happy whether it is through music or products. Balmuda's aim is to provide exciting experiences for a joyful life. Experiences are conceived as a combination of input through our five senses and in many experiences, sight is the first source of input. Therefore, to deliver a wonderful experience, design is an important factor in our products. Q. What is a design that gains value over time? Among your work, which is the most ideal for you and why? A. Fresh new designs become old from the minute they are created but products that have been well thought through remain beautiful throughout time. To create something beautiful, one needs to contemplate the true meaning and value of the product.Among my creations, Balmuda The Toaster is my most ideal in the sense that we created an appropriate design for a tool that serves delicious toast. Q. Your experience as a member of a rock band and working at a factory stands out. Did they influence product development and design at Balmuda Inc.? A. Whether it is a tool or a service, everything traded in the market is a combination of art and technology. Music combines these two aspects at a high dimension by using technology, such as the musical scale and instruments, and outputting in an artistic form. Creating a suitable beat or groove is also important, as well as the determination to excite and make people happy. Music taught me these important principles and we value them in Balmuda as well. Q. Why did you start focusing on small household appliances? Is there a large appliance you would like to innovate in terms of design?A. I simply started with a genre that seemed within my reach. I might design something bigger someday, possibly vehicles.Q. Simplicity is not only seen in products made by Balmuda Inc. also its packaging. Balmuda Inc. has made name for itself as the 'Apple of small household appliances.ï'What are your thoughts on this?A. We try to keep our creations simple, whether it is the product, packaging, catalogue or instruction manual. As technology advances, the mechanism of products is becoming more complex and at the same time the artistry that attracts people is becoming more diverse. This may be why simplifying the appearances of products is becoming the mainstream. Apple was one of the first companies to elevate technology and art to a very high dimension which is something that Balmuda is also trying to realize in our products.Q. It is not easy to capture both simplicity in design and functionality. How was Balmuda Inc. able to achieve both? A. At Balmuda we keep our ideas simple. We contemplate peoplesï'desires and come up with one simple value that we want to offer. Our designs and functions turn out to be simple because what we want to realize through the product is simple and straightforward.Q. Small household appliances made by Balmuda Inc. are in high demand despite their higher-than-average price tags. Many customers point to the design as the reason for their high popularity. Why do you think Balmuda Inc. products are in demand? A. I don't think people purchase our products only for their design. For example, the value that GreenFan delivers is 'comfort.ï'The soft natural breeze, the quiet operation along with its beautiful design are all aspects that contribute to delivering comfort. We are not creating home appliances, but tools that deliver wonderful experiences and this is why we have been successful so far.Q. Could you give an example of a product made by Balmuda Inc. that has achieved innovation via design?A. If in this question the term 'designï'refers only to the configuration of a product, I would say none of our products have achieved innovation.Q. Balmuda Inc. has gradually expanded its product portfolio. It now includes office equipment, home appliances and kitchen appliances. What is next?A. I can't not give away details but in the upcoming year we hope to introduce a new line of products to follow our air series and kitchen series.caps:George Popescu Herald Design ForumSung Jung-gi Herald Design ForumGen Terao Herald Design ForumLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERNET OF THINGS (89%); COMPUTER NETWORKS (88%); CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (78%); ENGINEERING (78%); AUGMENTED REALITY (75%); CERTIFICATES  DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (73%); BEER & ALE (69%); PERIODICAL PUBLISHING (68%); COMPUTER SCIENCE (68%); ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (67%); CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (62%); MOTOR VEHICLES (54%); 3D PRINTING (53%); NANOTECHNOLOGY (52%)CITY: PARIS, FRANCE (55%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); UNITED STATES (79%); FRANCE (72%)LOAD-DATE: November 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

"354","Baltic States adorn tourism jewels",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","Baltic States adorn tourism jewels   THE KOREA HERALD June 12, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 12, 2017 MondayBaltic States adorn tourism jewels LENGTH: 1217 wordsAhead of the centenary of proclaiming statehood next year, the three Baltic countries have unveiled a myriad of tourism offers for international travelers, introducing the northern European nations as an integrated destination. As only Latvia has an embassy in Korea of the Baltic States -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- the diplomatic mission organized a tourism promotion seminar in Seoul on May 15, where some 20 public tourism officials and numerous other travel company representatives participated. ??By promoting ourselves together as an integrated destination, we can consolidate our strengths and make ourselves more attractive to tourists,?? Latvian Ambassador to Korea Peteris Vaivars told The Korea Herald in a separate interview at the embassy. ??Everything starts from an initial contact, which leads to better knowledge of each other and creation of durable links. Slowly but steadily, the number of Koreans visiting the Baltics is growing, roughly 10,000 annually.??To introduce the Baltic Year 2018 celebrations, the embassy is putting all efforts to strengthen tourism between Korea and the Baltic states, giving lectures at schools, universities and cultural organizations, as well as engaging with the media and participating in international events, the envoy added.The embassy, which recently relocated near Hangangjin Station in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, has produced a Baltic travel map with information on popular and hidden spots in the Korean language. The three nations are part of the Schengen Area: a zone comprising 26 European states that have abolished passport and border control at their mutual borders to encourage unrestricted travel. No visas are required to travel across the three countries and for those from Korea. The three states all use the euro currency. Riga is the largest city in any of the Baltic States and home to one-third of Latvia??s 2 million people. The Latvian capital has well-preserved architecture dating back to the Middle Ages, earning it the nickname ??the Pearl of the Baltic Sea.?? Designated the European Cultural Capital in 2014, it has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world. The capital??s historic center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 for its many buildings constructed between the 16th and 19th centuries. The city offers a myriad of festivals and performing arts throughout the year, including choral, opera and ballet concerts and art exhibitions. Major events for next year are Lattelcom Riga Marathon in May, Riga Opera Festival in June, Riga City Festival in August and Staro Riga light festival in November. Estonia offers urban attractions, ecotourism and picturesque islands, among others. There are over 190 nationalities residing in the country of 1.3 million people, more than two-thirds of whom are Estonian. Most travelers spend the bulk of their time in Tallinn, which offers rich cultural and historical heritage, shopping venues, scenic beaches, spas, saunas and delectable cuisine. Other popular cities are Narva and Tartu, famous for architecture, wellness, nature and theater. Lithuania has a population of 3 million, and its capital is Vilnius. The country offers safe and secure tourism, unadulterated natural landscape, rich historical heritage, fast internet and ease of communication for foreigners, according to its State Department of Tourism. Vilnius has modernist buildings in Kaunaus and medieval capital Kernave, both included on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. Historic city and lake resort Trakai, Baltic coastal city Klaipeda and the Hill of the Crosses are also popular.??Having emerged as independent states from the ashes of the First World War, the three Baltic countries share a common geographical, historical and cultural mentality,?? the ambassador explained, adding the region was under German, Swedish and Polish rule before the liberation. ??We understand that we can be more attractive when we are united. That??s why we all joined the European Union, eurozone, Schengen Area as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It??s important for us to be cooperating under the current volatile international situations and be part of these organizations. We also collaborate in step within the EU to have more attraction.??Strong mechanisms for cooperation exist for the Baltic States regarding EU matters, and they try to formulate similar or common positions to punch above their weight in global affairs, the diplomat added. He also said the three countries now operate many intercultural and economic linkages with one another, and compete in a ??positive and healthy way?? to spur growth and innovation.??There is positive competition between us that leads to healthy growth,?? according to Vaivars. ??We turn our eyes and ears to what is going on around us and envy any progress made by another neighbor. For example, if Estonia made strides in information communications and electronic government, Latvia wants to copy that and improve its own systems.??Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia regularly organize Baltic ministers?? meetings and interparliamentary meetings, as well as the ??3+5?? Baltic plus Nordic cooperation channels and Council of the Baltic Sea States assemblies. The Baltics are similar in many ways to the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, and consider themselves to be Nordic, the envoy said. ??The distance between Nordic and Baltic countries is getting shorter. My hope is that one day there won??t be any division between the Baltics and Nordics and there will be just Nordic countries. Another way to think of us is to look at the ??Benelux?? political and economic union of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.??Latvia, similar to its Baltic neighbors, was in dire straits with no governmental institutions and market economy following its liberation from the Soviet Union in 1991.??Latvia was the 10th richest country in Europe in 1939, but over 50 years of Soviet rule did huge damage to our economy,?? the ambassador stressed. ??Particularly as we feel more and more threats from our neighboring country Russia, we feel that the decisions that we made immediately after our independence in the early 1990s -- joining the strategic organizations EU and NATO -- were absolutely right.??Through the last 25 years, large differences were accrued and can be observed in countries that didn??t join these organizations, he added, noting they have developed economically at a slower pace and achieved little in reforms, while facing greater Russian influences in internal affairs.Highlighting that early exchanges through tourism will spark mutual interest and eventually lead to greater economic cooperation, Vaivars pointed to Latvia??s strengths in wood and timber, furniture and interior design, pharmaceutical, chemical, food, cosmetics and fashion industries, with Korea being the second-largest export market in Asia after China.The delegation at the maiden tourism seminar in May included officials from the Riga Tourism Development Bureau, Baltic Travel Group, Con-ex Latvia Tours Group and Estravel Latvia. The event was supported by Finnair, Lufthansa, Korea Tourism Organization, Korean Association of Travel Agents and Seoul Tourism Organization.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (90%); INTERNATIONAL TOURISM (90%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (90%); PASSPORTS & VISAS (89%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (89%); FESTIVALS (89%); HISTORIC SITES (89%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (87%); ARCHITECTURE (85%); DESTINATIONS & ATTRACTIONS (78%); ECOTOURISM (78%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (78%); GOVERNMENT TOURIST OFFICES (78%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (78%); TOURISM (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (73%); TRAVEL AGENTS (73%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); HISTORIC DISTRICTS & STRUCTURES (67%); ARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONS (66%); BORDER CONTROL (64%); BALLET (60%); OPERA (60%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (52%); EURO (50%)CITY: RIGA, LATVIA (94%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); TALLINN, ESTONIA (79%)STATE: ATLANTIC OCEAN (78%)COUNTRY: BALTIC STATES (98%); NORTHERN ASIA (96%); LATVIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); EUROPE (93%); NORTHERN EUROPE (92%); ESTONIA (90%); LITHUANIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: June 12, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"355","[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost   THE KOREA HERALD August 23, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 23, 2017 Wednesday[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost LENGTH: 862 wordsDavid Neumark, an economist at the University of California-Irvine, could safely be called a minimum-wage skeptic. Neumark has written a number of papers on the topic, all of which have found that minimum wages reduce employment by substantial amounts. This makes him a bit of an outlier in terms of the overall research consensus, which tends to find modest or no employment effects.But unlike many researchers, who maintain a laser-like focus on the question of whether minimum wage cuts jobs in the short term, Neumark has examined the policy from many angles. A recent paper of his, along with Grace Lordan of the London School of Economics, looks at how automation responds to minimum-wage increases.This is a timely research paper, because many people are worried about automation making human workers obsolete. It??s pretty obvious that higher minimum wages give employers an incentive to replace humans with machines. For example, fast-food servers can be partially replaced with automated kiosks. Japan already has plenty of these, and they work very well -- you order your food from a menu, get a ticket and pick it up at a counter.Lordan and Neumark focus on so-called automatable jobs. Economists don??t really know which jobs are more vulnerable to automation -- few might have predicted that hedge-fund managers, for example, could be put out of work by robots -- but they can make some guesses. Lordan and Neumark use the definitions of automatable jobs provided by star labor economists David Autor and David Dorn. These jobs are mostly of the routine variety -- fast-food workers, for example.The authors find that when states have higher minimum wages, low-skilled workers are less likely to work in automatable jobs. That implies that minimum wages really do spur business owners to replace humans with robots. They also find that when minimum wages are high, workers with automatable jobs are more likely to become unemployed. That could indicate that unemployment rises when minimum wages increase, but it could also just mean that when minimum wages are high, low-wage workers with routine jobs tend to switch jobs more often.Lordan and Neumark??s findings seem to confirm people??s fears that minimum wages will hasten the dreaded rise of the robots. That will certainly be used by minimum-wage opponents to make policy makers think twice about raising the wage floor. But this fearful reaction is probably overdone. Automation spurred by high wages could be a very good thing for the economy, in the long term.To see why, we should first think back to the Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain and the Netherlands in the 1700s. This was the greatest, most spectacular episode of automation that ever occurred -- miners, farmers, weavers and craftspeople of all types were put out of a job by steam engines, power looms and other machines. This hurt lots of people, but in the end, it resulted in the greatest explosion of human wealth and prosperity in history.Why did this happen? No one knows for sure, but one major theory is that high wages spurred the creation of industrial technology. Economic historian Robert Allen notes that labor was especially expensive in pre-industrial London and Amsterdam, with British wages especially high. Where businesspeople in China or India or Russia might hire armies of low-paid workers to make cloth or mine coal, British entrepreneurs had to find ways to make machines to do those jobs, because human hands were just too expensive.But unlike hiring a bunch of cheap workers, investing in innovation has positive spillovers -- one invention leads to another. Thus, high wages might have provided the spark that set humanity on the path to its current wealthy state. Growth economist Paul Romer, currently chief economist of the World Bank, formalized a similar idea in a 1987 paper. Romer hypothesized that low labor costs are actually bad for development, because they reduce the incentive to innovate and invent.Seen in this light, automation resulting from high minimum wages could be a long-term blessing. As long as humans find new useful things to do, installation of automated kiosks, self-checkout machines and industrial robots will be a boon to the workers?? wealth. There will be a period of adjustment, in which some low-wage workers are hurt. Neumark claims this adjustment will be large, although other researchers claim it will be small. But ultimately, as long as human labor doesn??t become superfluous, faster automation is a good thing.Therefore, the only people who should be scared of the long-term technological impact of higher minimum wages are pessimists who believe that humans are on the verge of obsolescence. But even these pessimists should realize that if obsolescence is on the way, lower minimum wages won??t slow it down by much. If we??re facing the rise of the robots, we might as well face it now.So don??t be scared that the minimum wage will replace human labor with machines. Ultimately, saving labor is what technology is all about. And it looks like the minimum wage can help.By Noah Smith Noah Smith is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: MINIMUM WAGE (93%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); ECONOMICS (90%); EMPLOYMENT (90%); FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS (88%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (78%); SERVICE WORKERS (77%); LAYOFFS (77%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (77%); WRITERS (73%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (72%); ELECTRONIC KIOSKS (52%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (84%)STATE: CALIFORNIA, USA (92%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); NETHERLANDS (79%); UNITED KINGDOM (57%)LOAD-DATE: August 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

This move is believed to be an attempt to promote a right-wing historical viewpoint, instead of pushing for a much-opposed plan to adopt a state-authored book.In its policy plan for 2017 submitted to Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, Monday, the ministry said it would apply similar guidelines for private publishers as those used in the state-authored history textbook which was virtually scrapped.'There has been controversy about a political inclination in history textbooks because we did not have strict approval standards,' Minister Lee Joon-sik said. 'The standards will be stronger and we may have publishers make public their drafts online and collect public opinion.'He said the new guidelines are aimed at helping children develop a balanced view of history. The ministry will announce the guidelines by the end of this month.Under the plan, the government is likely to push private publishers' books to include controversial content written for the state-authored history textbook. For example, it states Aug. 15, 1948 as the foundation of the Republic of Korea (ROK), instead of the establishment of the ROK government, which liberal historians say undermines the significance of the independence movement during the Japanese occupation (1910-45) and the establishment of the provisional ROK government in exile in Shanghai in 1919.The publishers may also be forced to have critical views of North Korea and favorable views toward former President Park Chung-hee, the father of President Park Geun-hye. The military strongman's economic development will be stressed while the human rights violations under his 18 years of dictatorial rule will be downplayed.Cho Wang-ho, a teacher who wrote one of the private publishers' high school history books, said, 'It means the government won't approve textbooks unless they suit its taste.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEXTBOOKS (94%); HISTORY (90%); CONSERVATISM (90%); TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); LIBERALISM (76%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (73%); CHILDREN (73%); PRIME MINISTERS (71%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (50%); SEPARATISM & SECESSION (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SHANGHAI, CHINA (52%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); CHINA (79%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The Ministry of Education on Friday said it is currently discussing ways to regulate hagwon, or private education institutions, aiming to reduce the study load, especially for young children. 'We will soon decide on specific measures to regulate hagwon hours and tuition and also propose a law revision to change the criteria for establishing such institutes,' a ministry official said. The recent discussions on hagwon regulations seek to resolve the impact of a recent decision to ban public elementary schools from running English afterschool classes for first- and second-graders, starting from March, so as to prevent excessive studying for young children. The Education Ministry, while aware that it is difficult to control private institutes, saw it is time to more strictly regulate the overheated private education sector and also reduce the financial burdens on parents. As the private education market in the country has long thrived, there have been criticisms of excessive pressure on students. But opinions are divided on the ministry's policy, as some criticize that the government is encroaching on the freedom of both educators and students.By Jo He-rim (herim@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (92%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (91%); CHILDREN (90%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS (73%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (73%)LOAD-DATE: January 5, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

A bomb blast tore through a subway train deep under Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg April 3, killing several people and wounding many more in a chaotic scene that left victims sprawled on a smoky platform. / AP-YonhapRussian Ambassador to Korea Alexander TimoninRussia's envoy speaks about attackThe April 3 blast on the St. Petersburg metro system will never be justified as it was a crime against all of humanity and against all religions without exception, Russia's top envoy says.'I would also like to remind that terrorism has no nationality,' Russian Ambassador to Korea Alexander Timonin told The Korea Times. 'It is also unacceptable to connect terrorism with someone's national background or religious beliefs.'On April 3, the blast ripped through an underground train in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, killing 14 and injuring 50 more. So far no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, and investigators have not announced a motive.The suspected bomber was one of the 14 killed; authorities identified him as 22-year-old Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen.This attack was known as the worst terrorist attack outside the North Caucasus since two suicide bombers killed 32 people in Volgograd in four years ago.'Whatever were their motives, another thing is the point of utmost importance. Terrorism will never be justified,' the diplomat said. 'This is the common approach of the whole international community.'The diplomat said that it was too early to talk about any organizations at the present stage, which could stand behind humand crime in St. Petersburg.According to the Russian Investigation Committee, the personality of the suicide bomber who committed the blast in the subway train is identified, but nevertheless the investigation process is underway, and Russia would be able to determine the organization responsible for the terrorist attack only upon completion of the investigation, he added.'I am convinced that solidarity, which was expressed not only by our allies but also by virtually all the states and what is more significant, by common people, reflects understanding of the necessity to join efforts in fight against terrorism,' the ambassador said.'I would also like to use this opportunity and express my sincere appreciation to acting President of Korea Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se for passing words of support and condolences to the Russian government and people.'Flowers are laid in front of Embassy of Russia on April 4. / Courtesy of Russian EmbassyTo root out terrorism around the world, Moscow has made efforts to fight it and remain constant for many years, Timonin said.'The President of the Russian Federation thoroughly introduced Russian views at the fight against terrorism at the General Assembly of the United Nations 70th Session in September 2015 and reiterated it recently during phone conversations with U.S. President and leaders of Turkey, Japan, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia and other countries who called after the tragedy to express their condolences,' the envoy said.Calling terrorism a 'global threat undermining security of all the countries of the world,' Timonin said that in these circumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to make declarations about the threat of terrorism and at the same time turn a blind eye to the channels used to finance and support terrorists, including revenues from drug trafficking, the illegal oil trade and the arms trade.'It is equally irresponsible to manipulate extremist groups and use them to achieve someone's political goals, hoping that later one will find a way to get rid of terrorists or somehow eliminate them. We consider that any attempts to flirt with terrorists, let alone arm them, are shortsighted and criminal acts,' he said.'Russia proposes to draw upon common values and common interests rather than ambitions. Relying on international law, we must join efforts to address the problems that all of us are facing, and create a genuinely broad international coalition against terrorism. Terrorism is an evil that must be fought by joint efforts.'After the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences and sympathy to the families of those killed and injured.The president said he spoke with representatives of security agencies and the FSB director. Its law enforcement and security agencies have been working to establish the cause of the explosion and provide their assessments of the situation. City authorities, and if needed, federal authorities, will take the necessary measures to help the families of those affected by the blast, the leader said.'The reasons behind it are not clear yet, and so it would be premature to speak about them.

He is among a chorus of security experts who now say that a simple natural language sentence, for example, ""It is a lovely day in Spain,"" is a better password than the tortured, numbers-letters-and-wingdings combinations we are all burdened with remembering. ""The truth is, it was barking up the wrong tree,"" he says.Well, what do you know?Unfortunately, his mea culpa comes a bit too late for us. We've wasted years of our lives changing passwords, not because we're security freaks, but mostly because we can't remember those impossible combinations of numbers, upper and lower case letters, special characters and symbols. Humanity, says computer expert Cormac Herley, a researcher at Microsoft, spends the equivalent of 1,300 years each day typing in passwords. Holy cow! And we thought YouTube surfing for cat videos was a time suck.Password security is important, given the many high-profile corporate and social media hacks of supposedly secure computer networks, and complex combinations can be effective deterrents. But the trade-off is between passwords that are easy for others to guess and passwords that are impossible for us to remember. And when we can't remember, we tend to do stupid things, like writing complex passwords on sticky notes on our computer monitors or on paper tucked beneath our mouse pads. And as ingenious as we think we are, switching numbers for words (""Good4you"") or adding another number (""Good4you2), isn't always a security improvement, either.If it seems like we are always fighting the last war, we are. A password that would have taken more than three years to crack in 2000 might have taken about a year to crack in 2004. Five years later, the same password could be broken in just four months, and now it could be decoded in a matter of weeks. But how could Burr have known that he would be responsible for so much global cussing and frustration for so little security in return? Back then, scant research existed on passwords; mind-numbing sequences seemed like the best solution.Experts predict that passwords as we know them will eventually give way to biometrics like fingerprint sensors and face recognition technologies found on some smartphones and consumer products. And who knows what after that?We can't wait to see it happen.

Each week, a new disaster or national embarrassment changes everything, producing a high volume of new information as well as disinformation, chipping away at the very way society shares knowledge. But Jon Huer, a sociology professor and former Korea Times columnist, presents a great deal of insight into Trump as well as his supporters in his 12th book 'Donald Trump: Made in the USA.'Writing between Trump's upset victory last November and around his January inauguration, Huer couldn't have known how ugly Trump's presidency really would be. But his analysis is so thorough as to be predictive of future events, such as the racially driven clash in Charlottesville and its aftermath.'Imagine the crowd lining up on opposite sidewalks across the street supporting their own candidate, one side having the Trump supporters and the other side the Clinton crowd,' he writes in his book, released by University Press of America's imprint Hamilton Books. 'One side is very light, the other side very dark. Both sides are ardently cheering and shouting but would they be doing that in good spirits? We are sure the media would describe this as a race war, whites vs. non-whites. Violence may break out, shots may be fired, and law enforcement would surely be called.'Written months prior to that incident, it's closer than Nostradamus ever got.Huer then accurately explains Trump's Aug. 22 campaign rally in which he claimed to have condemned racial hate, reciting his words but neglecting the important 'on both sides.' As Huer says, Trump isn't lying because he can't remember. 'Technically he is a liar, but morally he is not, just like a child or an insane person who does not really remember that he indeed committed X,' Huer writes.What's more, Huer predicts how this affects the White House, where Trump becomes torn between his fascism and his capitalism, leading to the disbandment of economic counsels and the ousting of Steve Bannon. Huer predicts Trump's downfall will come when the moneyed elite turn on him, either deposing him or taking away his power so he can go back to occupying himself with pleasure and amusement.""If you are not angry or worried about America, it's because you are a happy American who has been fed garbage for decades now,"" Huer writes, mirroring the final public Facebook post of Heather Heyer, killed in Charlottesville, which shared the anonymous quote 'If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.'Huer, rather than chasing the headlines about the latest controversy or trying to actually predict an unpredictable president, takes a step back and looks at the Trump nation through a sociological lens. It's macro but hardly objective in tone: he likens Trump's win to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, while comparing Trump himself to Hitler.He isn't much more sympathetic to Trump's supporters, going beyond Hillary Clinton's epithet of 'deplorables' and calling them 'garbage Americans.'His reasoning is that modern societal factors such as consumer capitalism, social media technology and news as entertainment, leading to mental garbage that has destroyed the intelligence and humanity of white Americans. White Americans in particular because they are the intended beneficiaries of consumer capitalism, and they live a more isolated life than many non-white communities, which Huer refers to throughout the book as 'lesser Americans.' Ironically the dominant position of white Americans led directly to their downfall.He sees the same traits in Trump as in his supporters: childishness, selfishness and vengefulness. But rather than identifying Trump as a master strategist or opportunist, he sees Trump as the creation of the public that hangs on his every word and tweet; he is the president America deserves, its punishment for out-of-control consumer capitalism.This national embarrassment has revealed to the world the illusion of the American dream, exposing the real America that is a 'superpower armed with hate and brute force.' Trump, as the American most adapted to his surroundings, represents the spirit and mood of America better than anyone, Huer says.Huer's analysis has its faults. For one, he mentions Trump's germophobic dislike of handshakes, long since forgotten following his grappling-move handshakes with countless world leaders. He singles out Snapchat as a 'nothing invention,' while underestimating the needs of its users to resist making a digital footprint. And he sees white Trump supporters and non-white Trump opponents as serving their racially opposed self-interests, while seeing white Trump opponents as altruist going against their natural self-interest for the good of the whole, rather than seeing through a conman's lies and false promises or having their own self-interest in a tolerant and educated society.This book review ironically took extra time to complete, as it was read on the same digital devices Huer so criticizes, forcing his words to compete with endless alerts and news updates. Trump's election, Huer concludes, hasn't changed anything - it has only exposed to the world the cage America has been building itself for decades.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); SOCIOLOGY (90%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (77%); BOOK REVIEWS (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); WRITERS (74%); ETHNIC CONFLICTS (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%)COMPANY: UNIVERSITY PRESS OF AMERICA INC (55%); FACEBOOK INC (50%)TICKER: FB (NASDAQ) (50%)INDUSTRY: SIC2731 BOOKS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING & PRINTING (55%); NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (50%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (94%); STEVE BANNON (73%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (94%)LOAD-DATE: September 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It has been operating since 1986, but has been at its current location since just 2015. When it moved from its previous location at Coex to Insa-dong, the museum received a major face-lift. Instead of the traditional museum style of showing kimchi-related artifacts behind glass, Kimchikan makes use of digital technology to feature touch screens and audio guides that allow visitors to explore the history of the dish and to virtually make kimchi themselves.For visitors who want the real experience, Kimchikan offers hands-on classes of making kimchi. The classes are offered to groups of five or more foreign visitors or children, and alternate between spicy kimchi and white kimchi. On Wednesday, 21 students from the Ganada Korean Language Institute took part in a class to make spicy kimchi. Carefully watching the instructor??s hands on a big screen, the participants mixed the seasoning into sliced radish and rubbed it into prepared cabbage.??It??s better than the kimchi we have at our guest house,?? one participant said as she tasted the seasoning.Since its move to Insa-dong, Kimchikan has hosted about 11,400 people in its hands-on classes.

With the instillation of political consciousness, popular culture also sought inspiration in symbolic moments from Korea's modern history such as the June Struggle of 1987.The film ""1987: When the Day Comes,"" which depicts the people's resistance to the authoritarian regime of former President Chun Doo-hwan, attracted over 4.2 million viewers. President Moon Jae-in watched the film Sunday and said, ""The movie shows when we muster up our power, the world will change.""The musical ""Gwanghwamun Love Song"" is a jukebox musical featuring songs of the late composer Lee Young-hoon. The plot revolves around Myeong-woo, a middle-aged man at death's door who goes on a journey to his past with the guidance of transcendental character Wolha.The musical is staged at the Grand Theater of Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, located in the heart of Gwanghwamun where the candlelit rallies were held last year.As Myeong-woo reminisces on his first love, the audience is taken back to the 1980s. Instead of showing off heroic characters at the head of student demonstrations, ""Gwanghwamun Love Song"" strikes a chord in the heart of those who chose to be ordinary, or in other words cowardly. Myeong-woo's girlfriend Su-a joins the student demonstrations, but Myeong-woo tries to dissuade her from taking part.Playwright Koh Sun-woong soothes the hearts of the ordinary people who were at the front of campus demonstrations, but strived to live their lives amid turbulent times.The musical runs until Jan. 14.A scene from the musical ""Sandglass,"" which is based on the hit 1995 drama of the same name / Courtesy of Insight EntertainmentThe musical ""Sandglass"" is based on the 1995 drama of the same name, which is still one of the highest-rated TV series in Korean broadcasting history.It spans a longer period of time in Korea's modern history from the 1960s to 1990s, covering a variety of events from the 1980 Gwangju Uprising to corruption in the early 1990s.Protagonist Tae-soo is forced to become a gangster because of his North Korean father, while his love interest Hye-rin, daughter of a wealthy casino owner, joins laborers in her father's munitions factory to protest her father.The 24-episode drama is condensed into two hours and 50 minutes and some of the events are abridged, but the musical still tries to convey social messages.""Sandglass"" runs until Feb. 11 at the Grand Theater of Chungmu Art Center in central Seoul.A scene from the Room Seoul episode of the play ""The Helmet"" / Courtesy of IM CultureCloser look into student movementUnlike the two grand musical productions, ""The Helmet: Rooms Vol. 1"" is an immersive and experimental play composed of two episodes -- ""Room Seoul"" and ""Room Aleppo."" In each episode, audiences choose where they sit -- Big Room or Small Room -- upon purchasing a ticket and watch the same plot from different views, as the small theater is divided by a folding door cutting through the stage diagonally.""Room Seoul"" is set in 1987 and 1991 when students fought for democracy, after the government tortured a university student to death.Upon beginning, three young students talks about why they are drinking soju to produce empty glass bottles for Molotov cocktails, instead of enjoying peaceful college life.Then the backdrop shifts to a basement storage room of a bookstore in front of a university. The bookstore owner takes in two student activists who are pursued by ""baekgoldan"" and hides them in a secret chamber.Baekgoldan, which literally translates to white skull squad, is a notorious group of combat police specializing in suppressing campus demonstration. They were known for wearing white helmets and jean jackets and used shorter cudgels for better mobility.The baekgoldan officers joke around at first, but soon reveal their true colors as they already know the existence of the hidden room after receiving a tip-off from a mole they planted among the student activists.What makes ""The Helmet"" stand out is its portrayal of female characters. One of the two hiding students is female and she grows up during the play from a naive first-time demonstrator to a leader of the student activists. She finds the mole and finally confronts the baekgoldan officers valiantly.The film ""1987"" was criticized for eliminating the narrative of women in the democracy movement, but ""The Helmet"" provides a look at women in student activism. Also the intimate atmosphere of the theater makes audiences feel the heat and tension of the student movement more closely.Another episode 'Room Aleppo' centers on the White Helmets of Syria and different stances on the volunteer organization amid a long-running civil war.""The Helmet"" runs until March 4 at the Daehakro Art One Theater 3.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: THEATER & DRAMA (90%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (90%); HISTORY (89%); CORRUPTION (89%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (89%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (89%); MUSIC (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (77%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (77%); FILM (76%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); TELEVISION RATINGS & SHARES (75%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (73%); DRAMA LITERATURE (71%); TELEVISION PROGRAMMING (60%); THEATER (58%); CASINOS (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (73%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%); KWANGJU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (58%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%)LOAD-DATE: January 9, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

"364","Harnessing hope of social science",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","Harnessing hope of social science  Korea Times February 10, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesFebruary 10, 2017 FridayHarnessing hope of social scienceBYLINE: By Helga NowotnyLENGTH: 937 wordsVIENNA - In his opening address at the 2016 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony, Nobel Foundation Chairman Carl-Henrik Heldin drew parallels between our current milieu and the late nineteenth-century world in which Alfred Nobel lived and worked.Nobel's era was one of rapid industrialization and economic expansion. Progressive political ideas about peaceful international cooperation flourished, but nationalism, xenophobia, geopolitical tensions, and terrorism were also on the rise. Anarchists assassinated a Russian Czar, an Austrian Empress, and American and French presidents, and the outbreak of World War I dealt a near-fatal blow to European civilization.The similarities to today's world are obvious. Scientists continue to surprise us with amazing discoveries, and billions of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty. But dark clouds have formed on the horizon. Terrorists have struck Europe with a vengeance, and millions of refugees fleeing wars and hunger are taxing European institutions, and straining social cohesion. Populist movements have emerged, calling for closed borders and new walls, and their rejection of expertise has led Heldin to a 'grim truth': that 'we can no longer take it for granted that people believe in science, facts, and knowledge.'Of course, our expectations will always be in tension with reality. A decade ago, hardly anyone would have predicted that the European project would be tested by a massive influx of refugees and asylum-seekers. Before Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, it was hard to imagine that a mendacious conspiracy theorist who flouts all rules of political decorum could win enough support. And prior to the Brexit referendum, few expected that a majority of British voters would swallow the lie that they could retain the benefits of European Union membership without any of the responsibilities.Our imagination is constrained by past experience, and this contributes to a lack of foresight. But while our capacity to predict the future is limited, social-science research into the problems we confront today may be able to loosen those constraints. The social sciences are often considered pessimistic; in fact, they are based on hope: a deep-seated belief that social improvement is possible.The intellectual roots of today's social sciences ¡© newcomers compared to the humanities and natural sciences ¡© are to be found in Nobel's milieu. The political, economic, and social turmoil that emerged in response to rapid industrialization and urbanization caused many to wonder whether order was even possible. The social sciences developed in the shadow of the nation-state, which had to develop a functioning administration, modern institutions, and policies to support order.Much of the work that followed was guided by the belief that technological progress is inseparable from social progress. Today, the International Panel on Social Progress ¡© a major international effort based on the work of some 300 social scientists ¡© shares this belief, and recognizes the importance of good governance in all policy fields. Good governance is the lynchpin that holds societies together in an era of uneven globalization, accelerating technological innovation, growing inequalities, and social injustice.So, could we have foreseen the political events of the past year? As it happens, an impressive body of social-science research shows that the mounting public disaffection that policymakers ignored or simply missed had been in the making for some time.Politicians, the media, and the public may have neglected the white working class; but social scientists did not. One does not have to quote Thomas Piketty to know that rising inequalities now threaten to tear apart the social fabric of the advanced economies. Such inequalities have been analyzed since the 1980s. And the working and living conditions for the most vulnerable populations in Europe and the US have been studied by social scientists for years.Meanwhile, much of what we know about terrorism ¡© the conditions that fuel it, who is susceptible to radicalization, how terrorist networks function ¡© comes from social scientists who have patiently gathered data, conducted interviews often under difficult conditions, and analyzed terrorist networks for many years. And there are numerous studies that shed light on nationalism and populism, too.These problems persist, despite our insight into them, because of the complex relationship between scientific knowledge and human action. Cognitive biases limit our ability to foresee future outcomes, leading to unintended consequences when we turn ideas into action. We are not good at understanding the complexity inherent in large, interlinking systems, from which major, unexpected events can emerge.Knowledge alone can never replace action. Graphs, figures, simulation models, and even seemingly incontestable facts make no difference until action and context are taken into account. And this raises additional questions: How do we apply the knowledge that we have, and what comes next when we do?If we want to avert Heldin's 'grim truth,' we will have to build bridges between knowledge and possible courses of action. In an era no less tumultuous than Nobel's, social science furnishes us with the hope that our situation could be different, because it generates the knowledge to make it so.Helga Nowotny, a former president of the European Research Council and Professor Emerita of Science, Technology, Society at ETH Zurich, is the author of 'The Cunning of Uncertainty.'

Djuna expressed surprise at the public's denial of the movie's intention and the background of sexual assault when the movie came out in 2005. The film critic added that it did not matter so much how one watches the movie, but rather the acknowledgement of the main issue at hand: sexual assault. Many Twitter users agreed with Djuna's perspective and shared the post. According to the film critic, the overall plot of the movie incorporates many similar elements to the Hanssem rape case. Released in 2005, 'Rules of Datingï'portrays the relationship between English high school teacher Yurim and art teacher-in-training Hong. Throughout the movie, Yurim persistently requests Hong make love to her and she finally succeeds after the two drink together. The plot bears close similarity to what might have happened between the Hanssem employees with the female victim's denial of 'consensual sex,ï'contrary to the suspect's claims. At the time of the movie's release, the online community fiercely debated whether it was 'rapeï'or 'the beginning of love.ï'Some criticized the movie for its glorification of rape and harassment. 'Rules of Datingï'was co-written by Ko Yoon-hee and director Han Jae-lim for his debut production. Despite negative reviews, Han's film received the 2005 Best Film Award from the Busan Film Critics Association with main characters Park Hae-il and Kang Hye-jung.

He served as the administrative secretary of the parliamentary committee on education, culture, sports and tourism and played a key role in raising the issue of the blacklist of artists who were critical of the government and subsequently excluded from subsidies, created by the former Park Geun-hye administration.Do held a press conference Tuesday and said he will renew the ministry, hit by the Choi Soon-sil scandal. He emphasized artists have the right not to be monitored, censored and excluded and the ministry will ""support artists without interference,"" according to the arm's length principle.With Do's wide experience in culture and education and his political ability proven through two terms in office, the cultural circle considers Do the right man to reform the ministry.Lee Seung-yeop, CEO of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, said appointing Do as the new culture minister was a natural choice. ""There are no people who have an antipathy to Do in the cultural world,"" Lee said. ""There have been many artists who became culture ministers, but Do has experience in administrative work.""Lee said he expects Do to restore trust between the government and artists damaged by the blacklist.Since Do himself is an established poet, the literary circle has high hopes for him as he understands artists well.Choi Won-shik, chairman of the Writers Association of Korea, expects Do will guarantee freedom of expression as enshrined in the constitution.Kim Il-kwon, CEO of independent documentary film distributor Cinema DAL, said Do played an important role in revealing the existence of the cultural blacklist and thus he will restore confidence when he becomes the culture minister.

He is someone who knows how to strike the balance between the conservation and utilization of cultural heritage.Kim took the post in August when the Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) had piles of controversial issues such as the approval of the Seoraksan Mountain cable car connecting Osaek to Kkeutcheong Peak and preservation of the Bangudae Petroglyphs.Kim is known as a self-made man who entered civil service with a high school diploma. He joined the formerly Cultural Heritage Bureau in 1981 and carried out a variety of tasks on cultural heritage for some three decades. He also served as president of the Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation from 2013 to 2014 before making a return to his home ground CHA.Kim majored in economics at the Korea National Open University and is currently pursuing a master's degree in cultural heritage conservation at the Graduate School of Cultural Heritage, Kongju University.Though he spent almost all his career around cultural assets, the administrator position is special for him.""I will do my best to promote the value of cultural heritage and let it enrich the national brand of Korea,"" Kim said at an interview with The Korea Times. ""There are various areas and positions related to cultural heritage and the key is to gain sympathy among the people concerned. Heretofore, I was one of the parties concerned, but now I have to listen to those all interested in the issue and draw cooperation among them.""The Cultural Heritage Administration offers various programs at cultural properties including ancient palaces to take a step closer to the public. / Courtesy of CHAKim emphasized that utilization of cultural properties should be on the premise of conservation.""There are various perspectives on life and as our society diversifies, we encounter more differences in views and ideas. In case of cultural properties, its historical and cultural values clash with economic and commercial values increasingly,' administrator said.""It's not that we only pursue usage of cultural assets. Preservation should be the priority since it cannot be restored exactly the same once damaged and development is inextricable from conservation.'He gave the example of the ongoing controversy over the installation of an aerial cableway in the Seoraksan Mountain in Gangwon Province.""The Cultural Heritage Committee endorsed the value of preservation, but we cannot turn away from the county wanting to make good use of the cultural assets they have,"" Kim said. 'It's important to obtain opinions from each side and go through enough deliberation.'Promoting the uniqueness and beauty of Korean cultural properties is CHA's major goal and thus one of the biggest tasks is to submit Korean cultural assets to UNESCO lists including the World Heritage list, Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list and Memory of the World.Earlier this week, three Korean documents - ""eobo"" (Korean royal seals) and investiture books from Joseon Kingdom (1392-1910); the archives of the National Debt Redemption movement (1907-10); and ""Documents on Joseon Tongsinsa,"" which documents Korean envoys to Japan during Joseon era - made their way into the Memory of the World list.""Cultural heritage occupies an important position in the national brand of Korea. The CHA will continue to exchange with other countries and international organizations such as UNESCO to become more influential,"" Kim said.Next in line are seven mountain Buddhist temples, including Beopju Temple, Tongdo Temple and Buseok Temple, for their representation of Korean Buddhism combined with indigenous beliefs such as ""pungsu"" geomancy theory as well as traditional architecture style.The culture of Jeju haenyeo (women divers) was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in 2016. Submitting Korean cultural properties for the UNESCO list registration is one of the Cultural Heritage Administration's tasks. / Courtesy of CHAKim's scope of activities has been widened since he has to visit many cultural properties across the nation as the cultural heritage administrator.""There are many great cultural assets outside the Seoul area as well. When I visited night tour programs involving cultural heritage, which are encouraged and promoted by the CHA, it was good to see locals come out, enjoy our tradition and create community. That's what our aim should be,"" the administrator said.""There are ancient palaces in Seoul, but many great old houses with rich history are located throughout the country. Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province is known for its relics from Shilla Kingdom (57 B.C. - A.D. 935), while Taean, South Chungcheong Province has beautiful costal sand dunes. Each region has unique gems and we plan to publish a cultural heritage map next year, integrating all information.""Throughout the interview, Kim put stress on sympathy and cooperation.""I have met a wide variety of people from cultural property restorers to volunteers who monitor and clean up assets. They all come from different backgrounds, but we all have the same goal - protecting the precious cultural properties. So I think we can cooperate for the common goal with sympathy,"" Kim said.

DeepMind wrote.??The research team behind AlphaGo will now throw their energy into the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,?? it said.Since its debut last year, AlphaGo??s outstanding performance against human Go masters has offered the public a taste of how AI, when applied to certain settings, can surpass human intelligence.During a series of matches held in Seoul last year, the gaming AI program??s victory against Korean Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol had proved to the public that AI??s implications are imminent and wide.Google is now slated to continue its efforts to apply the key technology behind AlphaGo -- a form of high-level machine learning called deep learning -- to perform difficult tasks in more critical human sectors.Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming.The US tech giant is already engaged in efforts to apply deep learning to the field of medicine. It has been training machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in an eye or cancerous tumors.So far, researchers at Google??s medical imaging team have made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world, according to the company.The tech giant is also working to apply deep learning to cancer diagnostics, developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.However, it will take some time before devices running on Google??s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval, said Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research.For those wondering what will happen to AlphaGo as it officially retreats from competitive play, Google??s DeepMind said it will publish a final academic paper detailing the algorithm??s efficiency and potential for general use later this year.The company said it will also work with Ke Jie to introduce a teaching tool that shows AlphaGo??s analysis of Go positions, providing insights into how the program thinks and giving the public an opportunity to see the game through the eyes of AlphaGo.

'In the process of linking various national demands, we can improve the quality of people's lives and create a lot of good jobs. This is the people-oriented resource recycling economy that is being pursued by the Korea Forest Service.ï'ã€€The World Health Organization recommends that a country maintains a per capita urban forest area of 9 square meters. According to the Korea Forest Service, the per capita forest area of Korea is 9.9 square meters and 'barely surpasses the WHO's recommendation.ï'ã€€In addition to the socioeconomic benefits, such as providing citizens with destinations for rest and relaxation, further expanding the country's woodland ecosystem is crucial in combating worsening air pollution and spikes in yellow dust emissions, the forest minister said. ã€€'The forest has so many functions, one of which is to purify air pollutants like fine dust,ï'said Kim. 'Korea's forests absorb a total of 1,070,000 tons of air pollutants per year, of which roughly 290,000 tons of fine dust is absorbed. This directly corresponds to the amount of dust pollutants emitted in the air by some 170 million vehicles a year.ï'ã€€'In addition, the woods also contribute to other functions including providing a sense of psychological peace of mind by helping reduce the volume of city noise,ï'he continued. 'In the future, as fine dust and summer heat waves continue to evolve and lead to serious social implications, I think that the role of urban forests as eco-friendly alternatives to solving such social issues will be heavily emphasized.ï'By Julie Jackson (juliejackson@heraldcorp.com) and Lee Kwon-hyoung (kwonhl@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FORESTS & WOODLANDS (90%); PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (90%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (90%); NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); AIR POLLUTANTS (89%); AIR POLLUTION (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EMISSIONS (78%); CITY LIFE (78%); CITIES (78%); SUSTAINABILITY (78%); PARTICULATE MATTER (78%); URBANIZATION (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (75%); APPOINTMENTS (70%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (64%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (63%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (63%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (50%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (98%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: September 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

He also served as chief of the reconciliatory committee regarding leukemia cases involving Samsung Electronics semiconductor workers.The other eight committee members come from the humanities and sociology, science and technology, survey and statistics and conflict management sectors.Kim Jung-in, a public administration professor at the University of Suwon, and Ryu Bang-ran, Korea Educational Development Institute vice president, represent the humanities and sociology.Kyunghee University chemical engineering professor Yu Tae-kyung and Korea Institute for Advanced Studies professor Lee Sung-jay, an expert in high energy physics, represent science and technology.The committee also includes Kim Young-won, a statistics professor at Sookmyung Women's University, and University of Seoul urban sociology professor Lee Yun-suk.For conflict management, the committee has Kangwon University sociology professor Kim Won-dong and Lee Hee-jin, a director at the Korea Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Center, a private organization specializing in conflict resolution.The government excluded people related to the nuclear and energy sectors, while maintaining a balance between men and women, and including young people who represent the future generation.Among the eight experts, three are females while three are in their 30s.The group of citizen jurors they select will determine the fate of the two reactors _ whether to permanently suspend the construction project or to resume it. The determination will be made in mid October.At a meeting with the media, new Energy Minister Paik Un-gyu said the government will gradually phase out nuclear power. The engineering professor is one of the scholars who support renewable and clean energy sources.'Instead of just canceling the construction of the two nuclear reactors, the administration is going through the democratic process of reaching a consensus among the public. The energy ministry does not have any prediction. We will just support the committee to be fair and transparent in its decision,' he said.The opposition parties are taking issue with the legitimacy of the special committee.Rep. Kim Kyung-jin of the People's Party said, 'The committee's legal status is not clear. There is a possibility of a breach of the law in the suspension of construction of the 5th and 6th Shin Kori reactors.'He said the Moon government's push to suspend construction has no legal grounds.'Under the current laws, the suspension of nuclear power plant construction is only possible through Article 17 of the Nuclear Safety Law. The legitimacy of the Moon government's step to suspend construction is not justifiable as it's an administrative action that lacks legal grounds,' Kim said.Rep. Lee Chae-ik of the Liberty Korea Party also said he will launch a campaign to publicize the problems with the committee.'We oppose the Moon government's reckless nuclear policy which excludes experts and which has been pushed without consultation with the National Assembly,' Lee said.During the election campaign, President Moon Jae-in had pledged to make Korea a nuclear free country, scrapping all plans to build new nuclear reactors.President Moon ordered the setting up of a committee of private-sector experts to determine whether the project should continue or not.Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, the state-run nuclear power plant operator, suspended construction following the order, despite fierce opposition from subcontractors as well as its union and residents near the construction site.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); SUPREME COURTS (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); JUDGES (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); SOCIOLOGY (90%); JURY TRIALS (89%); ENGINEERING (89%); ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (86%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); DUE PROCESS (78%); ENERGY & UTILITY POLICY (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICY (77%); POWER PLANTS (77%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); CONSTRUCTION (77%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (75%); LAWYERS (75%); CONSTRUCTION DELAYS & STOPPAGES (75%); LEGAL SERVICES (75%); POLITICS (73%); CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (72%); SEMICONDUCTORS (68%); PHYSICS (67%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (67%); SINGLE SEX EDUCATION (66%); LEUKEMIA (53%); PARTICLE PHYSICS (50%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD (56%)TICKER: SMSN (LSE) (56%); 005930 (KSE) (56%)INDUSTRY: NAICS334310 AUDIO & VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (56%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (56%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (56%)LOAD-DATE: July 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"371","International studies in Korea",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"April","International studies in Korea  Korea Times April 12, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesApril 12, 2017 WednesdayInternational studies in KoreaBYLINE: By Kevin Kester & Loughlin SweeneyLENGTH: 786 wordsKorean International Studies colleges have taken off in the past decade. There are at present more than a dozen programs nationwide offering social sciences degrees in a variety of disciplines, most notably international relations and international business programs, taught in English.The International Studies colleges host a diverse mix of international and Korean faculty and students. They contribute substantially to the internationalization of higher education in Korea making the country more attractive to international students who wish to study a university degree in English in East Asia. The International Studies colleges also contribute to the global research capacities of the host institutions by promoting international collaborative research with scholars and universities outside Korea.The trend toward these International Studies colleges began in 2001 with the establishment of the Division of International Studies (DIS) at Ewha Womans University, and then in 2002 with the creation of the DIS at Korea University. This then followed quickly with English-based International Studies programs created at Hanyang University (2004), Hannam University (2005), Yonsei University (2006), and the Solbridge International School of Business (2007).The newest of these programs, established on March 2 of this year with the vision to build upon the successes of the earlier schools and to offer new perspectives on international affairs, is the Endicott College of International Studies at Woosong University in Daejeon. The college offers three majors: Technology, Management, and International Studies, with a fourth option for students to create an Interdisciplinary Studies degree by combining courses from each of the three major subjects.The utility of International Studies is clear enough: it provides students with a valuable global perspective, a more methodical way of approaching problems and thinking critically, and provides a basis for wide employability, from global business to politics to academia. But establishing, teaching, and learning the field of International Studies also provokes big questions about the contemporary world, and the future of Korea.There are three broad challenges that International Studies in Korea must address if it is to succeed in its mission of increasing global interconnectedness. First, we must address the assumption of rationalism in learning: this is the idea that there is only one ¡®right' way to learn.Second, we must overcome the assumption of rationalism in teaching: that there is only one ¡®right' way to teach. In a complex globalized world, this approach is overly narrow. We must accept that there are no absolute answers to complex questions of development and peace-building, and put aside the illusion that 'correct' modes of development mirror Westernized ways of doing things. The shortcomings of this viewpoint are becoming increasingly apparent in today's world. Therefore, we propose multiple ways of learning that engage various faculties, feelings, and intuitions, examines them systematically, and appreciates complexity.Third, International Studies should become truly transferable. Our aim is to ¡®zoom out' from a narrow, academic focus and marry theory to practice and local vision with global agendas. International Studies can and should become an area of expertise that people in all walks of life find useful and relevant to their lived experiences.To overcome these challenges, at Endicott we engage with new International Studies in a three-pronged approach. We call these methods trans-rationality, embodied practices, and reflexivity, though, simply stated, the aim is to transcend International Studies' focus on Western ideas and its emphasis on individualism, and to embrace Korean knowledge and experience in a world that increasingly needs global, de-centered insights.Looking forward, Endicott College's Department of International Studies differs from other international colleges in Korea by asking the big questions about modernity, globalization, and international peace-building, and expanding the field beyond its Western core. Such questions generate critical dialogue and debate on enhancing 21st century international cooperation possibilities, especially in East Asia with Korea as a leader.Kevin Kester is research assistant professor of International and Area Studies, and chair of the Department of International Studies, at Endicott College of International Studies, Woosong University.Loughlin Sweeney is research assistant professor of History and International Studies at Endicott College of International Studies, Woosong University.

"372","Calling for Energy Department's death",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Calling for Energy Department's death  Korea Times January 5, 2017 Thursday   Korea TimesJanuary 5, 2017 ThursdayCalling for Energy Department's deathBYLINE: By Noah SmithLENGTH: 785 wordsWhen you hear the name Rick Perry, you might recall that time during the 2012 Republican presidential primary race where he forgot the name of a government agency he wanted to eliminate. After saying he wanted to ax the Department of Commerce and the Department of Education, he blanked on the third. Later in the debate, he said that his forgotten target for destruction was the Department of Energy.A responsible leader doesn't forget the name of a government agency that he wants to shut down. A responsible leader studies the department in detail, learning all of the things that it does, and thinks about how things would change if the department were abolished. And so for Perry, that 'oops' moment was enough to persuade voters that he lacked the firm grasp of the facts needed in a presidential candidate. He soon abandoned the race.But it seems like in the Republican Party of 2016, leaders are not rewarded for being responsible and informed. Instead, the party's leaders are rewarded for finding new targets, justified or not, for the outrage of their voter base.Unfortunately, this impulse for wanton destruction seems to be present at the intellectual level as well. In a recent op-ed in the Washington Examiner, economist Peter Grossman of Butler University called for the Energy Department to be closed. Unlike Perry, Grossman can at least remember his target; he's written a book calling U.S. energy policy a failure. But the case he lays out is weak and unpersuasive.Grossman views the Energy Department as a panicked response to 1970s-era theories of looming fossil-fuel scarcity:'The DOE was conceived in dark and pessimistic beliefs and forecasts that have proven totally wrong. ""The original legislation justified a Department of Energy because""we were (supposedly) rapidly running out of fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas.'In reality, the department was created in an effort to increase government efficiency by combining of a bunch of existing agencies. One of these was the Energy Research and Development Administration, the successor to the Atomic Energy Commission, which itself grew out of the Manhattan Project. That agency managed the U.S.'s nuclear weapons programs. This is still one of the Energy Department's jobs ? it includes the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile.Let that sink in a moment. Grossman is proposing to abolish the agency that keeps U.S. nuclear weapons safe. He doesn't appear to have thought very carefully about who would take over that task, or whether valuable experience and knowledge would be lost in the hand-off. He also doesn't seem to have thought about what would happen to the department's extensive system of national labs, which research all sorts of next-generation technologies.But even if we forgive these oversights, Grossman's story doesn't add up. The Energy Department's roots in nuclear energy also show that it wasn't simply a response to high oil prices. Government support for nuclear power boomed in the 1950s, when oil was cheap. The goal wasn't to avert a fossil-fuel crunch, but to give humanity even cheaper sources of power.That's still the department's goal. As Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports, solar energy is now cheaper than coal power in many places, even without government subsidies, and is getting cheaper still. As a partial result of this technological improvement, coal is on the wane, while solar is booming. Scaling plays a huge part in this process.Solar's rise hasn't come because of a fundamental technological leap, but because of learning curves. As production rises, prices tend to fall. Here, via BNEF, is a graph of how this has worked for solar panels:That means the Energy Department's subsidy programs, which encouraged solar growth back before the economics made sense, probably had a hand in jump-starting the era of abundant energy that we now see stretching before us.Grossman doesn't acknowledge this. He writes that 'the only energy breakthrough of the last four decades has been fracking.' That's a bit like saying that the only new piece of consumer electronics in the last four decades was the flat-screen TV.So no, we shouldn't heed Grossman's call to abolish the department. More to the point, we should just stop rewarding intellectuals and politicians for casually calling for the abolition of government agencies in the absence of understanding what they actually do.No doubt, my call is likely to fall on deaf ears, at least while the Trump administration is in power.

It is named after the location's address of 837 Washington Street in the middle of New York's Meatpacking District.A store run by its archrival Apple is placed less than 1 kilometer from the experience center of Samsung, which tries to outshine the Apple stores by its convergent approach involving culture, technology and humanity.'Samsung 837 provides an opportunity for the public to experience Samsung technology and signature services interacting with eight passion points through special events,' said Choi Bo-rham, a director of Samsung Electronics America's corporate marketing team.The passion points are art, music, entertainment, sports, wellness, culinary, technology and fashion.'Such a strategy is more appealing to New Yorkers,' she added.But there is one difference: it is not a retail shop so visitors cannot buy any Samsung devices there. Instead, the Korean entity offers cooking classes and art exhibits as well as other cultural events targeting Samsung products users and prospective customers.'Instead of selling products and making profits, we offer our vision of setting up a digital playground, where innovation of cutting-edge goods blends well with culture and arts,' Choi said.It has gained recognition as Forbes said in February that 'if there is a place where this electronics behemoth not only gets it right but is truly taking a leadership position, it is in innovation around consumer engagement through one of the slickest retail spaces around, known simply as Samsung 837.'Amid its growing recognition, celebrities including basketball player LeBron James, singers Gwen Stefani and John Legend, American chef Anthony Bourdain and photographer Nigel Barker have stopped by the marketing center.In addition, the New York Fashion Week in February was live-streamed through Gear VR and Gear 360 cameras, while about 1,600 people watched the 89th Academy Awards live on the main stage screen of the Samsung center in February.When visitors enter the center, they come across a three-story-tall screen made from 96 55-inch visual displays and controlled by video artists to display content ranging from live streams and demos to showcases.However, the biggest hit at 837 is the virtual reality tunnel, in which visitors can take a seat and put on Samsung Electronics' head-mounted Gear VR device for an immersive visual and audio experience of dynamic activities.The day after Samsung unveils the Galaxy S8 smartphone, it plans to come up with a new virtual reality program related to the new phone.In addition, it serves as a venue for unveiling new products and holds events for customers, while providing after-sales services to fix handsets, which takes only about two hours, much shorter than its rivals according to Samsung.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY (77%); CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (77%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (73%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (73%); CELEBRITIES (72%); PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES (72%); STREAMING MEDIA (71%); SALES & SELLING (71%); SINGERS & MUSICIANS (71%); COOKING & ENTERTAINING (71%); SALES PROSPECTING (71%); FASHION SHOWS (71%); PHOTOGRAPHY (71%); ANIMAL SLAUGHTERING & PROCESSING (69%); ACADEMY AWARDS (67%); FASHION DESIGNERS (67%); BASKETBALL (67%); MUSIC (66%); FILM (66%); VISUAL ARTISTS (66%); VIRTUAL REALITY (64%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS (60%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS AMERICA INC (55%); SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD (53%)TICKER: SMSN (LSE) (53%); 005930 (KSE) (53%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); SIC5064 ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES (55%); NAICS334310 AUDIO & VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (53%)PERSON: JOHN LEGEND (79%); LEBRON JAMES (75%); ADAM SILVER (55%); GWEN STEFANI (50%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (93%)COUNTRY: UNITED STATES (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (72%)LOAD-DATE: March 28, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

THE KOREA HERALD October 20, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDOctober 20, 2017 Friday[Kyle  Harper] Was the fall of Rome a biological phenomenon? LENGTH: 1056 wordsBill Gates is worried. The tech entrepreneur and philanthropist has been using his megaphone to warn us of the catastrophic risk posed by infectious diseases. In the Western world, where mortality from lethal germs has mostly receded into the background, the burden of infectious disease can seem like someone else's problem. But the struggle between humanity and infectious disease is never someone else's problem -- certainly not in our globally interconnected society. And while modern medicine has the upper hand on many old microbial enemies, we should beware the sinister ability of pathogen evolution to thwart our cleverest weapons.Gates is right. The risk of a 'big one,ï'a biological event that threatens to break down our public health infrastructure and rattle the foundations of the global order, is out there, lurking. On his side, Gates has legions of epidemiologists whose dire assessments can seem abstract. Human history offers us a deeper and more tangible sense of the unpredictable role that invisible biological enemies have played in the story of our species.Take the example of Rome. By any estimate, the Romans built one of history's most extraordinary civilizations. For hundreds of years, the Roman Empire controlled territory stretching from the frostbit frontiers of northern Britain to the scorching edges of the Sahara. The capacity to integrate conquered societies into the empire was a source of strength and staying power. Roman civilization was a lunge toward modernity, with greater social complexity and economic prosperity than ever seen before. And the fall of the Roman Empire represented the single greatest step backward in the long but uneven march of human civilization.What accounts for this epochal setback? There has never been a shortage of answers: Loss of virtue -- an old favorite, but long out of fashion -- class conflict, fiscal unsustainability, the technological development of 'barbarianï'civilizations, or some failure of immigration policy. Some 200 answers have been compassed, and the vast majority of them are human -- all too human.Historians inevitably make the best use of the evidence at their disposal, and in the last few years, that evidence has been revolutionized. What we are learning, principally from pathogen genomics, is that the fall of the Roman Empire may have been a biological phenomenon.The most devastating enemy the Romans ever faced was Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes bubonic plague and that has been the agent of three historic pandemics, including the medieval Black Death. The first pandemic interrupted a remarkable renaissance of Roman power under the energetic leadership of the emperor Justinian. In the course of three years, this disease snaked its way across the empire and carried off perhaps 30 million souls. The career of the disease in the capital is vividly described by contemporaries, who believed they were witnessing the apocalyptic 'wine-press of God's wrath,ï'in the form of the huge military towers filled with piles of purulent corpses. The Roman renaissance was stopped dead in its tracks; state failure and economic stagnation ensued, from which the Romans never recovered.Recently the actual DNA of Yersinia pestis has been recovered from multiple victims of the Roman pandemic. And the lessons are profound.In the first place, the biological agent of the great plague was a relatively young species. Y. pestis was not a germ that had existed for hundreds of thousands of years. To use our contemporary terminology, when it struck the Roman Empire it was an 'emerging infectious disease.ï'As old germs evolve new molecular tools, or entirely new germs arrive on the scene, the results can be tremendously destabilizing -- a reminder to modern societies that we must do more than keep track of known threats.Second, the Roman pandemic was no parochial affair. The closest known relatives of the strain that caused the Roman outbreak have been found in western China. This fact is consistent with the detail provided by ancient sources that the pandemic erupted on the coast of Egypt, at an entrepot of the bustling Red Sea trade. The deadly package was ferried into the empire across the vast Indian Ocean trade network that brought silk and spices to Roman shores. The plague was, then, an unintended side effect of incipient globalization.And finally, it was an event of mind-boggling ecological complexity. Plague is a disease of rodents, and the Roman pandemic event involved at least five different species: the bacterium, the rodents of central Asia that were the reservoir host, the Black rats that carried the germ to the west, the fleas whose bite transmits the disease between hosts, and the human victims. The plague was, in short, a conspiracy of human civilization and nature, in a way that the Romans could not have foreseen or imagined.Rome was far from the only advanced society shaken to its core by the explosive force of infectious diseases. The medieval Black Death sent some leading-edge polities -- like the communities of Italy -- backward, while opening the space for the ascent of others, such as England. The lethal role of pathogen exchange in the European conquest of the New World is relatively famous, if still imperfectly understood. The lightning dispersal of cholera around the globe in the 1810s, and the 1918 Spanish flu, caused by H1N1 influenza virus, are further examples of the devastation that germs can unleash when human societies offer them the right conditions.We are not as helpless in the face of infectious disease as past societies. We have germ theory and public health and antibiotic pharmaceuticals at our disposal. But the patterns of history can deepen our sense of the laws that govern civilization. Often, those laws are nature's laws, not humanity's.

Earlier in the day, Moon offered condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. student who died after being returned home in a coma following 17 months of detention in North Korea, and criticized the North's human rights abuses. / Courtesy of Cheong Wa DaePresident slams North Korea over US student's deathOtto WarmbierPresident Moon Jae-in harshly criticized North Korea, Tuesday, for its human rights abuses following the death of a U.S. citizen who was returned home in a coma after 17 months of detention in the North.His death is expected to worsen already-strained U.S.-North Korea relations and push the Donald Trump administration to adopt a harder attitude toward the reclusive state ahead of a summit with Moon next week.Cheong Wa Dae said Tuesday that the President sent a telegram of condolence to the family of Otto Warmbier, 22, a former University of Virginia student who died Monday, six days after he was released from North Korea.His family said Warmbier died of the 'torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans.''Moon offered his condolences to the family,' presidential spokesman Park Soo-hyun said. 'He also deplored the fact that the North does not respect human rights, a universal value of humanity.'In an interview with foreign media the previous day, the President raised the question over whether North Korea fulfilled its humanitarian responsibility such as telling the family immediately when Warmbier's condition took a turn for the worse, and offering the best possible medical treatment for Warmbier.¡®Dialogue with NK is necessary'President Moon told CBS in an interview Tuesday that North Korea had a 'heavy' responsibility in the process that led to Warmbier's death.However, the President said dialogue with the North was necessary since South Korea has failed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through only sanctions and pressure.Moon also believed his position was not at odds with that of President Trump's policy toward the North.'It seems to me that President Trump has criticized the failed former policies of his predecessors. And on that point, I have the same view as President Trump,' Moon said in the interview.He also made it clear that dialogue with Pyongyang will not happen unless certain conditions are met.A freeze of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs should come first, followed by the complete dismantlement of its nuclear programs, Moon said. Asked whether he would support a pre-emptive strike on the North, the President said he believed this could be discussed among the relevant heads of state if a threat becomes more urgent.He also said he hoped that conditions would become right for dialogue before the end of the year.'Just because we believe dialogue is necessary does not mean we have to be impatient for it,' President Moon said.Trump may suggest adding more pressure on the North over its nuclear programs rather than engagement during the summit with Moon in Washington, D.C., slated for June 29 and 30. The two leaders may have difficulty in coming to a unified opinion, as Moon's basic stance is to seek both sanctions and dialogue and a step-by-step resolution of the nuclear issue.Trump said in a statement, 'Otto's fate deepens my administration's determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency.'Republican Senator John McCain even said Warmbier was 'murdered by the Kim Jong-un regime.' 'The United States of America cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers,' he said in a statement.The Seoul government is watching how the situation develops and whether details about Warmbier's demise will be uncovered, such as how he fell into a coma. If he died from the results of torture or other mistreatment as his family claims, negative public sentiment toward Pyongyang in the U.S. and the international community will grow.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DEATH & DYING (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); INTERVIEWS (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (74%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (69%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (93%); DONALD TRUMP (89%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (88%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: June 20, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

This typical message, however, carries more weight because Nishimura is a transvestite who works during daytime as a renowned makeup artist.The seemingly weird mixture of professions started from a pre-teen identity crisis, which was overcome by self-enlightenment and matured into discovering a destiny of helping others look good while reminding them not to deny their natural appearances.Nishimura, 27, says cosmetic artists and monks have something in common in that they 'make others happy.''Each person carries a unique hue,' he says. 'My hands and heart make it shine brighter.'Nishimura has been travelling Tokyo and New York putting colorful touches on celebrities.His coming-out in 2013 did not solve his deep questions of 'why do people live' or 'why should people do good things.' This situation led him to train to be a monk, which he did two years later.He had pondered whether to give up either of the two worlds because being a cosmetic artist violates the rules of becoming a monastery member. But his makeup teacher encouraged him that 'when you go outside and grab attention, you are spreading Buddhism's message that all living creatures are equal.'Nishimura's Instagram page vividly portrays his life as a makeup artist. Outside the monastery, Nishimura lives an exotic life. His Instagram pages are filled with selfies of himself as a woman wearing different makeup styles and wigs; and photos of him with other models in glamorous outfits. Offline, he gives makeup lessons to other sexual minority celebrities in Japan.'Transgender people still have men's skin, which cannot be the same as that of biological women,' he says.'Transgender people need makeup techniques that can enliven their unique skin tone. When their confidence grows, I become happy too.'Realizing that his sexual orientation was unlike that of other boys when he was eight years old, he hid the fact throughout the teenage years and went to the U.S. to study fine arts after graduating from high school.But with a different skin color than that of Caucasians, his ethnicity-based psychological exploration continued, until Japanese model Mori Riyo won Miss Universe in 2007.Her typical Asian look, which did not have double eyelids or a sharp nose, became the champion's look with the help of makeup that accentuated such traits instead of hiding them. Riyo's make-up artist then taught him cosmetic techniques.Nishimura considers the world as a kaleidoscope, where everyone has unique beauty.'Whatever people say about your skin color, you go ahead and cultivate your own self,'he says.

Tokyo also just approved several social studies textbooks that claim Korea's easternmost islets belong to Japan.Since previous education guidelines did not mention Dokdo, many Koreans are concerned that Tokyo is reinforcing a distorted history education for future generations on baseless territorial claims. The guidelines, which are renewed every 10 years, will be fully applied to the elementary school curriculum starting in 2020 and in middle schools the following year.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs rightly called on Japan to withdraw the new guidelines on Dokdo and lodged a complaint with Hideo Suzuki, minister and deputy chief of mission at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. The Ministry of Education also strongly denounced Japan, saying that its claim of sovereignty over Dokdo is 'no different from its imperialist aggression of the past.' Japan should always remember that its wartime atrocities have brought despair and suffering to Korea and many other countries.It is highly regrettable that Tokyo has once again asserted its sovereignty over Dokdo amid escalating tension between the two neighbors over historical rows. Even before Tokyo's renewed claims to Dokdo, the two countries had not been able to resolve their differences over the issue of 'comfort women' statues in front of Tokyo's diplomatic missions in Korea. A prolonged absence of Japan's top envoy in Korea has severely hampered bilateral diplomacy. Tokyo recalled Ambassador Yasumasa Nagamine in January and he has not yet resumed his duties in Seoul.History education must be based solely on facts and the truth. Dokdo is an indisputable part of Korean territory from ancient times, based on historical facts and international law. Japan should withdraw the new education guidelines that will pave the way for its schools to teach illegitimate claims on Dokdo.Its attempt to reinforce its sovereignty over Dokdo will further damage bilateral relations. Tokyo should take note of the fact Korea has done a lot to keep bilateral relations moving forward. Despite strong opposition from the people and the victims of wartime sexual slavery, the Korean government has emphasized a consistent implementation of the 2015 bilateral deal on resolving the comfort women issue. Seoul also signed an information-sharing accord - the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) - last November with Tokyo despite negative public opinion.Now it is Japan's turn to show that it is willing to establish future-oriented relations with Korea.

THE KOREA HERALD July 18, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDJuly 18, 2017 Tuesday[Kim Seong-kon] Be lost in Pastland or prosper in Tomorrowland? LENGTH: 794 wordsIf you ask a scientist, ??What is a star??? he will probably answer, ??It is a gigantic mass of dust located in the universe far away from Earth.?? How unromantic! Yet it is the undeniable truth. In the eyes of a scientist a star is nothing but a round shaped mass of dust, earth and rocks orbiting in the universe in the dark. However, if you asked the same question to a poet or a student of literature or the humanities, the answer would be totally different. He will describe a star as the most gorgeous object he can dream of. And he will use all sorts of romantic words related to stars, such as rising star, shooting star, star-crossed lovers, stardust sky, starry, stellar, and movie star.To a certain extent, it is a matter of reality and fantasy. Scientists observe reality through telescopes and microscopes, whereas writers tend to fantasize. If you fantasize, you do not see the real person or real object. Instead, you only see the beauty created by your fantasy, which is far from reality. However, if you focus only on reality, you will never be able to see the beauty in it. In that sense, it is like the two sides of a coin. At the same time, it could be a matter of distance as well. That is to say, at a distance, you will find a star exquisite and gorgeous because you gain perspective. In a close range, however, even a star may look ugly and grotesque. While explaining his own literary theory of distance, Jacques Derrida said that a woman may look more beautiful and mysterious at a distance. So does a man. If you are too close for comfort, you may find undesirable things and shortcomings of the person or thing you see. Telescopes and microscopes are the devices that reduce the distance between our eyes and the objects we want to see. When I lived in the States, I felt my vision, which had been 20/20, gradually deteriorating as I spent my days reading books in the university library. I went to a doctor??s office to get a pair of prescribed glasses. When I wore the glasses for the first time in my life, the whole world looked different. I could see everything so clearly. For example, I could see all the freckles on the nurse??s face. In a sense, the corrective lenses reduced the metaphorical distance between my eyes and the nurse.Likewise, even a beautiful twinkling, shiny star may not be pretty if you see it in a short range. Perhaps all you can find is a gigantic dark globe made of dust, merely reflecting light from the sun. A star is beautiful only when you dream of it or fantasize it at a distance. Reality and truth can be uncomfortable and ugly sometimes. Perhaps that is why we need poetry, fiction, songs, and dreams. Otherwise, life will be too gloomy, desolate, and bleak. In his monumental book, ??The Interpretation of Dreams,?? Freud argues that our dreams reflect our unconsciousness called ??Id?? that is formed by what has happened in the past. Despite Freud??s scientific explanations, many romantic people want to believe that dreams are prophesying our future or a wish-fulfillment. Indeed, the lyrics of a Christmas carol go, ??I??m dreaming of a white Christmas.?? We also say, ??My dream is to become a doctor,?? or ??You are my dream girl.?? At school, we teach our students to dream for a bright future. Indeed, we need to dream on, even though the reality is harsh and miserable. In that sense, our new government should implement committees on building a bright future, rather than on investigating the dark past. If we cling to the past, we will not be able to dream of the future. Besides, we do not have the luxury of spending time and energy digging out skeletons in the closet. Instead, we should unite and concentrate our time and energy on making a better future. You cannot change the past, but you can change the future. If we cannot get over past specters, we will not be able to move forward. Then our future will be as gloomy as our dark past was. The recent movie, ??Tomorrowland,?? implies that as long as there are dreamers on Earth, we can avoid total annihilation and have a bright future. At the end of the movie, dreamers in different countries find campaign pins inscribed with T, which stands for ??Tomorrowland.?? We, too, should strive to find our ??Tomorrowland.?? It would be unwise and miserable if we were helplessly lost in ??Pastland,?? while other nations found ??Tomorrowland?? already. If we are stuck in the dark past, all we can see will be the ugly mass of dust. If we move forward, we will surely see beautiful stars shining in the night sky.

The Pinoy community in Korea somewhat differs on neighboring Asian countries. We don't have nannies or domestic helpers here. In the early 1990s, there was a surge of Filipino expat entertainers but lifestyle changes in Korea made the nightclub industry less popular. Most Filipinos here are working in a factory, students or women married to Koreans. Approximately 60,000 Filipinos live here which made it Korea's third-largest expat community, next to China and Vietnam.

"384","[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security?",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security?   THE KOREA HERALD June 5, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 5, 2017 Monday[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security? LENGTH: 1056 wordsAs the world focuses on neutralizing North Korea??s nuclear and missile brinksmanship, equal attention should be given to grave human rights violations in the country, a former United Nations official said, stressing ??there can be no security without accountability.??For Michael Kerby, former chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People??s Republic of Korea, the issue has been close to his heart. He grew up in postwar Australia watching newsreels of Nazi concentration camps being opened up by Allied Forces. As he later listened to the escapees?? testimonies of horrors they experienced in North Korea??s detention camps, they brought back flashes of his earlier memories, he recalled. ??In the understandable concern about peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and region, don??t forget the obligations to human rights in North Korea,?? Kerby said in an interview with The Korea Herald arranged through the Australian Embassy in Seoul. ??It??s easy to focus undivided attention on that very serious issue of terrible weapons of mass destruction being developed there. But there will be no security whilst there is gross lack of human rights. Peace and security and universal human rights are both in the preamble to the UN Charter, and are both interrelated.??In the absence of protection and accountability, he added, the dream of peace and security in and around the peninsula remains illusory.Explaining why the two issues are critically inseparable, the 78-year-old former Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1996 to 2009 asserted that a country that does not respect basic rights of its citizens ??inherently creates a potentially explosive environment?? where people cannot live stably for a long period of time. As North Korea is a UN member, the international community has every right to insist that it conforms to the UN charter and treaties regarding human rights, most of which Pyongyang has ratified, according to Kerby. While advising the new administration of President Moon Jae-in to foster inter-Korean ties and offer humanitarian assistance, the Australian maintained that the conciliatory initiatives should not come at the price of advocating the end of heinous crimes in North Korea.Kerby drafted the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK in 2014, which was designed to investigate ??systemic, widespread and grave violations of human rights?? in the country. The report brought to light the regime??s denial of access to food, detention of people in prison camps, torture and inhumane treatment, discrimination, enforced disappearances, as well as violations of right to life and freedom of expression and movement. The document was delivered to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in 2014 and led to a resolution sponsored by the European Union and Japan, which was then passed at the General Assembly. It was eventually sent to the Security Council to consider referring the North Korean regime, including leader Kim Jong-un, to the International Criminal Court for prosecution for their crimes against humanity. The report remains on the standing agenda of the council awaiting a reference to the international court. It has been blocked by Russia and China for ??political reasons?? -- both with veto-wielding powers as the council??s permanent members.Most experts see the UN-led measure as a symbolic initiative to increase political pressure on Pyongyang to improve its human rights record. The council also urged Pyongyang to ensure ??full, rapid and unimpeded?? access of humanitarian assistance to the people and cooperate fully with the commission and the special rapporteur. ??In this report, we pointed out that the situation in North Korea is virtually unique in the entire world,?? Kerby emphasized, adding that although virtually all countries have problems of human rights to varying degrees, the ??intensity, variety and duration of violations in the North are so severe that they call out for actions by the international community.????After more than 70 years, it??s still a challenge for the world,?? he added. The document, written with testimonies of North Korean witnesses, reported that 120,000 men, women and children were forcibly detained in prison camps across the country and subject to torture, rape, abduction, forced labor and abortion, infanticide, summary execution and starvation. Responding to some arguments that the world should not stir up the debate for the sake of enhancing political ties, Kerby countered by saying ??there is no evidence that North Korea responds to gentleness or sweetness of diplomacy.????Only after the commission published the report did the regime finally begin to take the issue very seriously,?? he continued, saying Pyongyang engaged in what he called the ??charm offensive?? of releasing three detained US citizens and declaring that it is open to nuclear and reunification talks. On the possibility of having to offer impunity to offenders for moving forward a prospective mechanism of transitional justice, as happened in Colombia with guerilla organization FARC, the retired Australian judge said ??crimes against humanity is a special species that demands accountability.?? He also underscored that the UN had ??never traded human rights for security interests.??Kerby expressed his support for strengthening North Korea??s economy, but elucidated that human rights is ??the other side of the coin of economic development?? and demands for improvement should not be pigeonholed. ??I agree with the argument (of supporting the North??s economic development) insofar as the country??s isolation is a serious impediment to its development, and that in turn makes it difficult to secure the necessary human rights levels,?? he explained. ??North Korea has enormous potential with minerals and other natural resources, but it??s cut off from the rest of the world and spending all its energy and capacity on nuclear development. It has thereby deliberately chosen a course of isolation and impoverishment.??As a practical solution, the Australian suggested restarting the six-party talks or forging some other form of a diplomatic mechanism, such as a peace treaty with North Korea. Such options have been outlined in the report, he said.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW (89%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (78%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (73%); FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (73%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (72%); VIOLENT CRIME (72%); EUROPEAN UNION (66%); SUPREME COURTS (64%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (64%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (58%); MOON JAE-IN (58%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); SWITZERLAND (79%); EUROPE (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"
"385","N. Korea has yet to master ICBM technologies",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","N. Korea has yet to master ICBM technologies  Korea Times February 6, 2017 Monday   Korea TimesFebruary 6, 2017 MondayN. Korea has yet to master ICBM technologiesBYLINE: By Jun Ji-hyeLENGTH: 1080 wordsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has claimed Pyongyang is ready to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but military experts say the test is highly likely to fail as the country's progress in key technologies remains dubious. They say Kim's ICBM threat is an apparent effort to send a message to the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump. / Graphic by Cho Sang-wonNorth Korea still has a lot of work to do in developing an operational intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), so the test it threatened to do will almost certainly end in failure, according to military experts.They said the North seems to have made progress in some technologies related to the intermediate- and long-range missile, such as stage separation, clustering of engines and guidance and control systems, but its progress in reentry vehicle capability and engine performance remain dubious.The analysis came as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un claimed, in his New Year's Day address, that Pyongyang has entered the final stage of preparations to test-fire an ICBM, in an apparent threat that the North is close to making a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking targets on the U.S. mainland.Pyongyang has never flight-tested road-mobile KN-08 or KN-14 ICBMs.On Jan. 19, the reclusive state reportedly has built two missiles, presumed to be the new ICBMs, and placed them on transport erector launchers (TELs) for the North's first test-firing of ICBMs.However, Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) in New York, downplayed the young leader's claim, saying 'in the final stages of preparation' may mean the state is not quite ready yet.'There is no sign yet that it has perfected a reentry vehicle robust enough to resist the heat and pressure of penetrating the atmosphere,' he said.Securing missile reentry technology is the toughest challenge in developing operational middle- and long-range ballistic missiles. As missiles reenter the Earth's atmosphere at Mach 24, the warhead needs to be capable of withstanding temperatures of around 7,000 to 8,000 degrees Celsius.In March last year, after its simulation test, the reclusive state claimed that it has secured the heat-resistant capability of the long-range missiles. But a South Korean military expert said, asking not to be named, the test environment was far different from that in real ICBM test-firing, given that the test temperature was only about 1,500 degrees Celsius.'I don't assess that the North has secured reentry vehicle technology,' he said.Terence Roehrig, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said it was difficult to know for sure how reliable Kim's claim was, albeit it could be a reliable claim for a future test. But he noted that being willing and able to conduct a test does not mean the test will be successful.'The record would suggest that an ICBM test will likely have problems,' he said. 'Though North Korea has improved its missile capabilities through its satellite launches, these have had difficulties.'Referring to last year's tests of the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM), he said, 'The tests had numerous failures before one that showed some degree of success and the likely ICBMs to be tested, the KN-08 or KN-14 have yet to be flight-tested so that the likelihood of failure in the short-term seems high.'Pyongyang fired a total of eight Musudan missiles between April and October last year, with only one flying some 400 kilometers. Most of the other missiles exploded right after takeoff.According to military officials in Seoul, the North's ICBM uses engines in the same series as those of the Musudan. They said the fact the only one of the eight tests was successful showed that the North has failed to correct faults in the missile's engines. Engine performance is essential in boosting the missiles, they added.'Each time North Korea tests, they learn from the attempt and their program continues to move forward,' Professor Roehrig said. 'But there remain some important question marks for making the entire system operational. North Korea still has a good deal of work to do in developing an ICBM capability, but they are making progress and they will continue trying.'Taking into consideration the North's dubious ICBM capability, military authorities here see the greater possibility for Pyongyang to launch the Musudan instead of the ICBM if it does decide to conduct any provocations in the near future. They said any launch will probably be aimed at mastering know-how linked to the Musudan, including the stability of its engine, as part of efforts to advance its ICBM capability.'We are closely monitoring any new military activities in North Korea, as it could launch an IRBM at any time if leader Kim Jong-un gives the order,' a military official said, asking not to be named.During a phone call with U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford last week, Seoul's JCS Chairman Gen. Lee Sun-jin cited the North Korean leader's birthday on Feb. 16, Seoul-Washington's joint Key Resolve exercise in March and the North's late founder Kim Il-sung's birthday on April 15 as possible days for the North's provocations.Message to TrumpThe Ministry of National Defense interpreted Kim's ICBM threat as part of the North's efforts to send a message to the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who was inaugurated on Jan. 20.Referring to the two suspected new ICBMs reported a day before his inauguration, officials raised the possibility that the North intentionally revealed the existence of the new missiles to send a strategic message to the new U.S. administration, which has hinted at carrying out a hard-line policy against the North.U.S. experts agreed with this view.'Kim's announcement could have been an effort to see how the Trump administration would respond,' Professor Roehrig said.According to Sigal, it is noteworthy that in the past, after each United Nations Security Council sanctions resolution was passed, the North responded with test-launches and nuclear tests, but it did not do so this time.'This could be a sign that it is waiting to see whether President Trump meant what he said during his campaign about wanting to negotiate with Pyongyang, as well as the regime change in Seoul,' he said. 'The statements by Kim Jong-un and the foreign ministry are a reminder of what is at stake if there are no talks.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: MISSILE SYSTEMS (91%); MISSILE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (90%); MILITARY WEAPONS (78%); US NAVY (73%); SCIENCE NEWS (72%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (72%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (71%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (63%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (88%); DONALD TRUMP (56%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (91%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (79%); EARTH (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); ASIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: February 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

As dean of the department of social studies education, I was not required to teach the class, but decided to as students need to learn about multiculturalism,' Mo told The Korea Times in an interview at SNU, Tuesday.Classes on school violence and special education are mandatory, but those on multiculturalism are not.Classes teaching multicultural education were initiated at universities and departments of education with government funding, but the education ministry has cut subsidies and many schools no longer offer the classes.Teachers who attended university before the classes were introduced in the curriculum have even less opportunities.Since 2008, the Seoul and Gyeonggi offices of education started offering classes on multiculturalism for teachers. However, they are limited to 15 hours a year, which is far from enough, Mo said.'The number of Korean students is shrinking, but that of multicultural students is growing. Students' receptivity of multiculturalism has improved, but multicultural students still face prejudice and bullying at school,' he said, pointing to the need for teacher training to be made mandatory under the new Moon Jae-in administration.Data from Statistics Korea shows the number of school aged children stood at 9.38 million in 2016, a 10.4 percent decrease from 10.5 million in 2010.In contrast, the number of school-aged multicultural children stood at 99,186 in 2016, more than a 200 percent increase from 31,788 in 2010.Multicultural children, who accounted for 0.44 percent of the student population in 2010, now accounted for 1.68 percent in 2016.Korea's efforts to embrace multiculturalismKorea was mostly homogeneous up until the 1980s, but it saw an influx of immigrant workers in the 1990s and immigrant brides in the 2000s. Due to the growing population of immigrants and their children, the government drew up its first policy to support them in 2006.In line with the policy, the education ministry revised the school curriculum so that textbooks would help students enhance their receptivity of multiculturalism.In the meantime, schools aid multicultural children in learning Korean and building their academic skills, and assist them in planning their careers.'Multicultural education has grown tremendously both in quantity and quality in the past decade,' Mo said.'In the next decade, as the multicultural population grows further, their countries of origin, reasons for immigration, socio-economic status and Korean language abilities will be diversified _ and education for these students will be specialized to accommodate their needs.'Learning from immigrant nationsCountries such as the U.S. or Canada, which began as immigrant nations, have far more advanced policies for immigrants.'What we can learn from these countries is the premise they had of immigrant policies _ that they were not merely welfare for minorities but for the nation as a whole,' Mo said.This is because immigrants contribute to the economy with the labor they provide, and with the taxes they pay. Young immigrants and their children can also provide a solution to countries with low birth rates, he said.'When neglecting them, they could pose instability to the nation, but providing them support will lead to social integration,' Mo said.He added these countries regarded policies for immigrants as important as defense, economic or labor policies.'In the long-term, Korea will need a government body solely dedicated to immigrant affairs,' he said.KAME hosted a conference last week, in which 40 presenters came from 17 countries.'There was a consensus that governments must adopt multiculturalism as the basis of policies, amid a widespread sense right-wing extremism and nationalism around the world,' Mo said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); CHILDREN (89%); STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS (89%); POPULATION GROWTH (89%); CURRICULA (89%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); RACE & ETHNICITY (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); SCHOOL VIOLENCE (78%); TEACHER EDUCATION (78%); CAMPUS SECURITY (76%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (73%); IMMIGRATION (61%); FOREIGN LABOR (60%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (97%); NORTHERN ASIA (97%)LOAD-DATE: May 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

However, the US pharmaceutical giant has been filing new patents over the drug's ""indications"" -- uses for treating particular diseases -- and other usage considerations to fend off biosimilars.ã€€Samsung Bioepis and its partner and minority shareholder Biogen filed a lawsuit in the UK in March last year, challenging the validity of such new patents registered by AbbVie.ã€€Humira is the world's best-selling drug for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, generating worldwide revenues of more than $14 billion for AbbVie in 2015.ã€€AbbVie CEO and Chairman Richard Gonzalez has repeatedly pledged to aggressively challenge copies of its top-valued drug, saying that the company's series of patents covering Humira will extend its exclusive status against biosimilars until at least 2022.ã€€A win for the Samsung company would pave the way for the Korean drugmaker and others to commercialize its Humira biosimilar in the UK as well as other European markets -- as the UK ruling could impact future patent jurisdictions in neighboring countries.ã€€Samsung Bioepis' Humira-referencing biosimilar, SB5, was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency, Europe's drug regulatory body, in July 2016.ã€€Samsung Bioepis could not be reached for comment. AbbVie declined to comment on the case, saying it ""does not comment on specific litigation"" when previously contacted by The Korea Herald.ã€€Lead up to trialã€€ã€€Months ahead of the upcoming trial, AbbVie had apparently attempted to settle the suit and end the UK-based proceedings, according to the court documents.ã€€In November last year, the US drugmaker had asked the three biosimilar companies to drop the proceedings in the UK in return for AbbVie abandoning its rights to the patents they were challenging.ã€€Samsung Bioepis and FKB did not accept this proposition, calling for a definitive judgment on this case.ã€€According to court papers summarizing Justice Carr's ruling on the need to continue this trial, the claimants argued that AbbVie's actions reflect its ""well-established strategy"" of dragging out patent proceedings for as long as possible, abandoning its patent rights at the last minute and then filing new, similar patents.ã€€Such conduct allows AbbVie to avoid courts from invalidating the US drugmaker's overlapping patents and removing uncertainty for the future release of biosimilars in the UK and other European markets, the claimants said.ã€€AbbVie had argued that a trial was unnecessary as it had already offered to give up its rights to the patents in dispute, clearing the way for the complainants to market their biosimilars in the future, according to the judge's note.ã€€However, the UK High Court dismissed AbbVie's request to suspend the trial, as Justice Carr appears to have recognized the validity of the complainants' arguments.ã€€""The judge at trial may well conclude that AbbVie has consistently adopted a policy of publicly expressing its confidence in its Humira patent portfolio, and its intention to enforce it against competition from biosimilars, while at the same time shielding patents within the portfolio from scrutiny by the court,"" Carr said.ã€€""It may be considered that AbbVie is 'willing to wound and yet afraid to strike' and that the time has come to put its professed confidence in its ability to prevent biosimilar competition to the test,"" he added.ã€€AbbVie's patent fight continues in USã€€ã€€In addition to the upcoming trial in the UK, AbbVie is engaged in other patent disputes over Humira in the US -- one with Coherus Biosciences and another with Amgen.ã€€AbbVie's composition patent on Humira expired in the US in December 2016, but the firm has filed multiple new additional patents to extend the drug's patent life in the country.ã€€In Amgen's case, it has already secured the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Amjevita, its Humira-referencing biosimilar. Yet the company most likely will not be able to commercialize Amjevita within this year, as AbbVie has filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement.ã€€Though it has yet to take legal action in the US, Samsung Bioepis is preparing to debut its Humira biosimilar in the US market as well. It has already completed SB5's phase III clinical trials in the US, according to the US National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov.ã€€Samsung Bioepis is a subsidiary of Samsung BioLogics, a contract drug manufacturer which went public in November last year.

Sim Sang-jeung, chairwoman of the minor opposition Justice Party and local civic group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy questioned accounting methods that led to a sudden rise in Samsung BioLogics' net profit in 2015.ã€€Samsung BioLogics, which has remained unprofitable since its foundation in 2011, suddenly reported a net profit of 1.9 trillion won ($1.66 billion) in 2015. The new influx of profit had been generated by a revaluation of its stake in its subsidiary Samsung Bioepis.(Samsung BioLogics)ã€€BioLogics explained its stake ownership was calculated into its net profit as a one-time event after Bioepis' status changed from a subsidiary to an affiliate under the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by Korea.ã€€A company is considered a subsidiary if the parent company possesses a majority stake in the firm, and an affiliate or associate if it holds a minority stake.ã€€Samsung Bioepis is a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics (91.2 percent) and US-based Biogen (8.8 percent). Under their joint venture agreement, Biogen can exercise a call option effective until the end of 2018 to expand its stake in Bioepis to up to 49.9 percent.ã€€Bioepis took on affiliate status after it underwent an audit to determine its market value and the costs that BioLogics would have to shoulder in case Biogen exercised its call option.The audit awarded Bioepis a valuation of 5.27 trillion won, based on an improved outlook for the firm's future profitability following the sales approval of its biosimilar drugs in Europe and Korea.The audit also concluded that the call option would cause a debt of 1.82 trillion won for BioLogics, which was reflected into the value of its stake in Bioepis which fell to 2.98 trillion won, BioLogics said.ã€€According to BioLogics, the rise in Bioepis' market value raised the weight and likelihood of Biogen's call option, which when exercised would weaken BioLogics' ownership over Bioepis. It was thereby under such circumstances that Bioepis took on affiliate status.ã€€Samsung BioLogics' net profit reported in 2015, hence, was calculated based on the change in its relationship to Samsung Bioepis, the company said. From 2016, Bioepis' performance is no longer included in BioLogics' accounting records.ã€€Rep. Sim and the PSPD took issue with this particular accounting method, saying it differs from that of Biogen which has not calculated its call option -- which it has yet to exercise -- when considering its stake in Bioepis.ã€€Samsung BioLogics credited this difference to varying accounting principles adopted by each company. While Biogen follows the US GAAP accounting standard adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BioLogics follows IFRS regulations.ã€€The Justice Party chairwoman and the PSPD also suggested problems with the calculation used to arrive at a multitrillion won evaluation for Bioepis, questioning its profitability outlook over the next five years.ã€€The market values of unlisted companies such as Samsung Bioepis are set by accounting firms based on projections of their future profitability. According to the IFRS regulations, this projection would be based on a maximum five year time frame, unless there are ""proper reasons"" dictating otherwise.ã€€The accounting firms had reportedly based its valuation of Bioepis based on a longer projection time frame of around 20 years, in consideration of the slow pace of new drug development and the pharmaceutical industry.ã€€""(Deloitte) Anjin determined Samsung Bioepis' valuation of 5.27 trillion won based on Samsung Bioepis' projections for the revenue and cash flow of its biosimilar drugs, their probability for success and the related risks,"" Samsung BioLogics said.ã€€Samsung BioLogics further argued that its ""one-time"" net profit generated by its stake in Bioepis ""did not impact the valuation of Samsung BioLogics (ahead of its Kospi listing) in any way.""ã€€""Samsung BioLogics had already met the listing standards of the US-based Nasdaq as well as Korea's Kosdaq even when it was in the red,"" the company said, adding that BioLogics' value was determined by its own production capacity and Bioepis' biosimilar development status in comparison to market competitors.ã€€Furthermore, Samsung BioLogics strongly denied recurring allegations that it received preferential treatment when seeking a public listing on the Kospi last year.ã€€In November 2015, Korea's Financial Service Commission revised its listing regulations to allow companies in the red to be listed on the country's main bourse. The revision allowed Samsung BioLogics, which had yet to generate any profit, to make a stock debut a year later.ã€€Samsung BioLogics stated it ""did not receive any form of preferential treatment during the process of its Kospi listing or after its public listing.""ã€€It reiterated its former stance that it had initially pushed for a public listing on the US-based Nasdaq, where many global biopharma companies are listed, but decided on a Kospi listing after repeated requests from the Korea Exchange to be listed on a local bourse.ã€€By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ACCOUNTING (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); COMPANY PROFITS (90%); CORPORATE WRONGDOING (90%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (90%); COMPANY EARNINGS (90%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (90%); AUDITS (89%); AGREEMENTS (78%); ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (77%); PARENT COMPANIES (77%); ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS (77%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (72%); APPROVALS (70%); JOINT VENTURES (64%); DEMOCRACIES (55%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (85%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (85%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (85%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (85%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (85%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); EUROPE (52%)LOAD-DATE: February 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

In fact, before his assassination, he called for the release of all political prisoners in Korea; including patriots and humanitarian figures such as pacifist hero Godang Cho Man-sik.?Kim??s chosen nom de plume, Baekbeom (roughly signifying ??ordinary person??), further lends credence to this conviction; he would have never allowed for the most persecuted and voiceless among our people to be politicized, effectively forgotten or lost to war. His pen name connotes an unfeigned empathy and unshakable solidarity with Korea??s most oppressed.?In the foreword to his popular memoir ??Baekbeom Ilji?? (1947), Kim humbly confesses, ??I agreed to the publication of this book not because I thought I was a great person but because I wanted it to be a record of an ugly and incapable man who lived his life as one among his people. My pen name, Baekbeom, signifies this intention of mine.???Baekbeom would have labored conscientiously to ensure that the lives of Korea??s most ferociously maltreated were effectually protected, freed and rendered necessary assistance forthwith -- as ostensibly guaranteed by core international laws and norms, and pursuant to the post-Holocaust worldwide commitment pledging ??never again?? would there be crimes against humanity, genocide or mass atrocity. ?What Carla Del Ponte -- formerly prosecutor for tribunals investigating atrocities in Rwanda and Yugoslavia -- recently pronounced with respect to the crisis in Syria doubtlessly holds true in North Korea??s case, as well. She, after resigning from the UN??s Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria citing ??absolutely no success,?? lamented, ??Believe me, the terrible crimes committed in Syria I neither saw in Rwanda nor ex-Yugoslavia. We thought the international community had learned from Rwanda, but no, it learned nothing.?? Del Ponte believes today she was placed in the role (in Sept. 2012) as an ??alibi.???A few years ago, UN investigators confirmed that the North Korean people??s suffering was ??unparalleled?? -- and evokes the Holocaust and Cambodia??s genocide. They invoked the global community??s categorical ??Responsibility to Protect?? the North Korean people. Notwithstanding, the emergency in North Korea with respect to political prisoners and North Korean refugees in China has become markedly and objectively worse. A staggering number of innocent individuals -- including very many children -- have suffered brutality and died without the slightest glimmer of a response.?Rather, these days, we hear only of deafening controversy surrounding THAAD, or terrifying, publicized threats attributing a comprehensively dubious ??legitimacy?? to the option of nuclear pre-emptive attacks -- such decisions would in actuality involve inhumane massacres of a maximally vulnerable, already heinously victimized civilian population, which the world has essentially skirted its clear-cut legal obligation to protect over several decades.?US Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has repeated ominous messages such as ??If there??s going to be a war to stop him (Kim Jong-un), it will be over there. ... If thousands die, they??re going to die over there (on the Korean Peninsula).???Sen. Graham horrifyingly alludes to nuclear preventive strikes, as have President Trump and other high-profile figures. ??There is a military option to destroy North Korea??s program and North Korea itself,?? Graham recently articulated to media.US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has threatened not merely the end of Kim Jong-un??s regime, but ??the destruction of its people.???The near proximity of nuclear test sites and facilities to North Korea??s political prisoners signifies that any strike against these localities would involve a genocide of those the world has already flagrantly failed to assist -- in keeping with central humanitarian obligations under international law.?North Korea??s political prisoners are routinely exposed to deadly radiation due to brutal slave labor such as forced excavation work at nuclear test sites performed without any protective gear. The tens of thousands of innocents in North Korea??s ??absolute-control-zones?? are all under a death sentence; every effort must be made to preserve their lives and deliver them out of these veritable killing fields. Over a million innocents have died in the North??s prison camp system. These are good people who need and deserve our help.?Though informed, committed and effective action prioritizing human rights is imperative, very little is even being said on the subject these days, perhaps owing to the fact that the North??s political prisoners would be killed first in the event of a preventive war. Instead, ??All options are on the table?? is reiterated.?In that case, South Korea, the US and the international community should commence vigorously to reaching out to the North Korean people, excluding the intractable and cruel Kim Jong-un. There is an enormous deal of alarm and discontent in North Korea presently that could be leveraged to achieve both denuclearization and the effective and long-overdue freeing of North Korea??s political prisoners.?In ??Baekbeom Ilji,?? Kim Koo acknowledges there were even apparent ??pro-Japanese collaborators?? who secretly harbored patriotism. After release from a prison controlled by Imperial Japan where he was severely tortured, Baekbeom learned via newspaper reports that Korean detectives had delivered him from certain execution by concealing his true identity to their Japanese superiors. He wrote, ??Though they were working as informers for the Japanese, these detectives were hiding inside their hearts a patriotic mind and a love of our people.???Innumerable like individuals exist within North Korea, even among the elites. Robust confidence-building measures must be directed toward them for the collaborative ??peaceful?? removal of Kim and the release of all of the North??s political prisoners forthwith.?This wouldn??t constitute artificial unification; rather, pursuant to international laws and norms, any regime that is manifestly failing to protect its population from genocide, mass atrocity and crimes against humanity forfeits its legitimacy. There is no human rights disaster in the world today as well documented as North Korea??s; the Kim despots themselves, who won??t spare uncle, brother, nephew or ??friend?? in their dogged pursuit of god-like power, are the culprits.?Baekbeom poignantly recounts another incident, where Koreans conscripted into the Japanese Army defected to the Provisional Government. ?He wrote, ??The students, who were raised in Japanese-occupied Korea and did not even know the Korean language well ... had come thousands of miles to the Provisional Government in order to devote their lives to the independence movement ... they had done this despite the danger of being caught and shot to death by the Japanese. Upon hearing this, our compatriots were so deeply moved that they could not find words to say.???A greater number of North Korean soldiers have already braved maximal risk to defect to the South; they are increasingly doing so at even greater peril, and most would assuredly defect if they encountered a viable opportunity. We must exhaustively and intelligently reach out to all of them, not muddle toward war. ?Baekbeom would likely additionally recommend for South Korea -- the sole state on the peninsula to successfully democratize and safeguard human rights -- to be far better protected and achieve self-sufficiency regarding its security expeditiously, having written ??Because I have felt the pain of being invaded by another nation, I do not want my nation to invade others. It is sufficient ... that our military strength is such that it is able to repel others?? invasion.???As The Korea Herald??s Aug. 11 editorial soberly admonishes, ??Misguided action can lead to chaos; now is time to review nuclear armament.??By Robert Park Robert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience.

"392","[John Nery] Can the world hold Duterte to account?",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[John Nery] Can the world hold Duterte to account?    THE KOREA HERALD June 21, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 21, 2017 Wednesday[John Nery] Can the world hold Duterte to account?  LENGTH: 1184 wordsAgainst the illegal drugs trade in his country, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has let slip the dogs of war and the havoc includes thousands of dead Filipinos, most of them poor. As he prepares to mark a year in office at the end of this month, those who are anguished about the killings ask: Can the community of nations play a role in holding Duterte to account?The answer is complicated.The case can be made that constitutional remedies have been all but exhausted. Impeachment is no longer an option. The controversial practice, copied from American political tradition, has played a role in unseating a president, a chief justice of the Supreme Court, and an Ombudsman (the government??s chief graft-buster) in the space of only a dozen years. It is a potent tool, especially given the constitutional provision allowing a mere third of the membership of the House of Representatives to directly send the impeachable official to trial in the Senate.But the House is firmly in the grip of Duterte??s so-called super-majority, and a potentially strong impeachment complaint against him was dismissed last month. A constitutional provision prevents the House from considering more than one impeachment complaint against an official every 12 months; last month??s dismissal effectively inoculates Duterte from another impeachment filing until May 2018.On the issue of the anti-drugs campaign??s extrajudicial killings, both chambers have essentially resolved to look away. The evidence presented by two confessed assassins who testified, against their self-interest, that they took orders to kill from Duterte when he was still mayor of Davao City was ridiculed or trivialized in the Senate, except as a basis to file charges against the two. And the House played a shameful role in laundering so-called evidence against Sen. Leila de Lima, Duterte??s staunchest critic. De Lima has since been arrested and is now in detention.Proclamation No. 216, which imposed martial law on the whole of Mindanao after the educational center of Marawi City was overrun by terrorists seeking to align with the Daesh network, is a wish come true for Duterte. He has frequently discussed what he describes as the necessity of invoking the so-called commander in chief powers; in August 2015, while exploring a presidential candidacy, he was open enough about his plans to establish a ??constitutional dictatorship?? or a ??revolutionary government.??But Duterte??s assertion of the martial law prerogative has been received timidly by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Instead of convening a joint session to deliberate on the proclamation, the super-majorities in each chamber insisted that a joint session was necessary only if Congress wanted to revoke, rather than affirm, the imposition of martial law. Then each chamber promptly passed resolutions affirming Proclamation 216. (Apparently, self-awareness and institutional dignity are not high on the list of values held by Duterte??s Congress.)But the case can also be made -- for the moment, at least -- that other institutions are helping keep Duterte in check. The Supreme Court continues to hear cases that have the potential to unsettle the Duterte administration. The Armed Forces of the Philippines has by and large acted with hard-won professionalism. Media organizations, despite orchestrated social media attacks against journalists, have continued to report the hard and necessary news. The Catholic Church, whose nationwide network is the country??s most extensive, is helping both the survivors of the anti-drugs campaign and repentant ex-members of the Davao Death Squad.It cannot be denied, though. The arithmetic of appellate-court collegiality actually favors Duterte; in another two months he would have appointed four justices to the 15-person Supreme Court. The military enjoys an advantage it can easily lose; professional officers are replaceable. Journalists labor under a much more hostile environment. And the institutional Church is slowed by internal conflict between those who support and those who resist Duterte.There is also the matter of the President??s popularity. A year into his single term, he continues to enjoy majority support. (In 2009, President Gloria Arroyo imposed martial law in the province of Maguindanao. Her unpopularity helped lead the chambers of Congress to promptly convene a joint session. Some of the same lawmakers who voted to convene then voted against it now scratch the surface of their statements, and one finds presidential popularity as a deciding factor.)But beneath the survey headlines lies a much more complicated reality. While a great majority of voting-age Filipinos say, consistently, that they support Duterte??s anti-drugs campaign, about three-quarters of survey respondents also say they do not want suspects in the campaign to be killed. About the same proportion of Filipinos say im reality rears its head that they fear they will be the next victims of Duterte??s war.What can be done, then, if the usual correctives against presidential excesses (a staunch Senate in Arroyo??s time, a stubborn Supreme Court during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III) will no longer be available? It is not the Association of Southeast Asian Nations way to get involved in domestic politics; as exasperating as Duterte??s about-face on China is to many of Manila??s ASEAN partners, it is difficult to imagine Duterte receiving even a friendly word of advice from a fellow head of state. Duterte??s closeness to both China and Russia is based in part on a no-criticism arrangement. On the other hand, and from the start of his presidency, he has taken the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union to task essentially daring them to take their business, their interests, elsewhere. The United Nations?? special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, the lawyer Agnes Callamard, has been actively monitoring reports of human rights abuses committed in the anti-drugs campaign, but the government says she is not welcome to come back to the Philippines. To be sure, it is difficult to imagine the UN or the EU dropping its human rights advocacy merely because Duterte refuses to listen, but the question of influence is a legitimate one. That leaves the International Criminal Court.A ??communication?? and a supplemental communication have been filed with the office of the ICC Prosecutor, calling for an investigation into alleged ??crimes against humanity?? perpetrated or masterminded by Duterte. The filing may have momentarily spooked the President; on at least two occasions, he publicly and categorically denied killing anyone. But the moment passed; he is back to making outrageous statements about personally killing criminals.

It takes them on average 23 years to rise through the ranks of a company and reach the CEO position.According to monthly business magazine The New Management, Monday, the average age of 123 CEOs including co-CEOs in the nation's top 100 companies was 60.6. It was the first time the average age passed 60 in the 23 years since The New Management started collecting related data in 1994.'The data shows Korean companies are reluctant to change their CEOs when facing external uncertainties,' the magazine noted.'The nation has faced a number of unstable external factors increasing market uncertainty such as the IMF crisis in 1997 and the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. Companies tend to maintain the status quo in management when external factors become unstable. It leads to longer terms for company CEOs.'Likewise, a number of top Korean companies decided to keep their CEOs this year.The nation's largest steelmaker POSCO decided to appoint incumbent CEO Kwon Oh-joon to serve another three-year term. Undergoing a massive restructuring process which includes selling non-core assets and saving costs amid the slowdown in the global steel industry, POSCO seems to have chosen stability over change. Kwon is 66.The trend is also evident in the electronics industry.SK hynix Vice Chairman Park Sung-wook, who has served the company as CEO since 2013, was reappointed for another term at the company's general shareholders' meeting last December. Park will also be 60 next year.Of the 123 CEOs, 40.8 percent were born in Seoul while 24.6 percent graduated from Seoul National University (SNU).It also shows that 22.3 percent of them majored in economics.The ratio of SNU-graduated CEOs was at its peak in 1994, accounting for 53.9 percent, but it has since declined every year to hit 24.6 percent this year.Of the 123 CEOs, 61, or 50.4 percent, had science and engineering-related majors while 43 CEOs studied business and 11 had social science-related majors.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EXECUTIVES (91%); COMPANY LISTS & RANKINGS (90%); IRON & STEEL MILLS (90%); DIVESTITURES (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); TRENDS (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (74%); SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); ELECTRONICS (73%); CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING (72%); ENGINEERING (71%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (62%)COMPANY: POSCO (55%)TICKER: PKX (NYSE) (55%); PIDD (LSE) (55%); 5412 (TSE) (55%); 005490 (KSE) (55%)INDUSTRY: NAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWING (55%); NAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURING (55%); NAICS331110 IRON & STEEL MILLS & FERROALLOY MANUFACTURING (55%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (87%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: April 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Seoul, where 38 percent of such schools are located, is also expected to overhaul its education system. There are 46 autonomous high schools, 31 foreign language schools and seven international schools nationwide that may lose their status and be turned into public schools, one of President Moon Jae-in's key election campaign pledges.The only official statement so far has come from Gyeonggi Province Education Superintendent Lee Jae-jeong who vowed to incrementally abolish 10 foreign language and private schools in the province by 2020. But it was Seoul that met a fierce backlash due to speculation that it will abolish 29 such schools.The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education refuted these claims Thursday, noting that although abolishing autonomous private schools is a Moon administration pledge, this remains uncertain as the new education minister has yet to be inaugurated. The office's education reform plan is still under review and will be announced June 28.The argument for abolishing the schools is that they lead to excessive early competition and that they have become an increasingly determinant factor for college admission. At Seoul National University, for example, the percentage of first-year students from private schools increased from 18.3% to 44.6% from 2006 to 2016, while that of students from public schools fell from 77.7% to 46.1% over the same period according to data obtained by Rep. Yoo Eun-hye of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) last year.On the other hand, some criticize abolishing private high schools may bring about an overall degrading of the education system. Parents of students currently preparing to enter the autonomous or foreign language high schools are also opposed to the move.Still, expectations are high that the education system will be completely overhauled under the Moon administration. President Moon as well as a majority of education superintendents has expressed the need to strengthen regular high schools and do away with other types of schools. The newly tapped education minister, Kim Sang-kon, a former school superintendent of Gyeonggi Province, is known as an icon for education reform, and a majority of the incumbent education chiefs are likely to support him. However, another major deciding factor will be the election results for education superintendents slated for June 2018.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIVATE SCHOOLS (91%); HIGH SCHOOLS (91%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (91%); EDUCATION REFORM (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (90%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (89%); SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS (89%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); ELECTIONS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (78%); LANGUAGE SCHOOLS (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (76%); ACADEMIC ADMISSIONS (73%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (71%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (66%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS (66%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (92%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

About half of the area is taken by coffee shops and bakeries and the bookshelves take up a rather smaller portion of the store.Jongno Books has about 100,000 books, which is about one fourth of the 430,000 books of nearby Youngpoong Bookstore. It displays best-selling books in more prominent positions while less popular genres such as humanities and classics take up small bookcases.The highlight of the bookstore would be its long reading table and five individual reading nooks, where people can comfortably read books before check out.""I like the reading space, but there are only five of them and I had to wait a while until it became vacant,"" Kim Ji-won, a 31-year-old office worker, said. ""There are cafes in the bookstore, so I can spend hours here, browsing books and having drinks.""Chongno Book Center was a popular meet-up in the 1990s in downtown Seoul. / Korea Times fileControversy of legitimacyThough their English name is different, the two bookstores' Korean names are the same, ""Jongno Seojeok,"" and it sparked controversy over the new bookstore's legitimacy.Jang Deok-yeon, president of the original Chongno Book Center, released a statement in January, soon after the opening of Jongno Books. He claimed that the new bookstore stole the name and history of the Chongno Book Center, the oldest bookstore with a 95-year history.The Chongno Book Center was founded in 1907 by the Korean Religious Tract Society during the late Joseon Kingdom (1392-1910). It was one of the major bookstores in Korea and had become a popular meeting point in downtown Seoul in the 1980s and '90s. However, the rise of modern bookstore chains such as Kyobo Book Center and Youngpoong Bookstore and change of the book sales market amid the growth of the internet made the old-fashioned Chongno Book Center fall behind competition. The bookshop went out of business in 2002.""The authentic Chongno Book Center has a long history with the pride of serving the country's publishing and reading culture,"" Jang said. ""Jongno Books is deceiving the public as if it inherited the Chongno Book Center, appropriating the name, the logo and even the phone number. In fact, it has nothing to do with the historical store that people remember.""Seo Bun-do, the CEO of Jongno Books, is a former executive from the Youngpoong Bookstore. He said the new Jongno Books is restored to create the cultural sympathy bonded by books. ""I didn't say we have a history of 95 years and tried to clarify that we are different from the original one,"" Seo said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: BOOKSTORES (91%); BOOK SALES (78%); BESTSELLERS (78%); BUSINESS CLOSINGS (72%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (68%); CLASSICS (68%); INTERNET & WWW (50%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (91%)LOAD-DATE: February 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is the first biosimilar copy of Herceptin to obtain such backing in Europe.According to protocol, the European Commission is set to follow the EMA's opinion by issuing marketing approval in around two to three months, upon which Samsung Bioepis can begin selling Ontruzant in European markets. Samsung's partner Merck & Co. is set to take charge of the drug's marketing.The EMA's endorsement sets Samsung Bioepis on track to bringing the first biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) to Europe and challenging sales of Herceptin, which generated around $6.8 billion in global revenue for Roche in 2016.'We are proud to see Ontruzant become the first trastuzumab biosimilar recommended for approval in Europe, where breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer affecting women,ï'said Samsung Bioepis CEO Ko Han-sung. 'If approved, we hope Ontruzant will play an important role in expanding patient access to trastuzumab across the region,ï'Ko said.Samsung Bioepis is closely being followed by competitors, including Korea's Celltrion, Mylan and Biocon and Amgen and Allergan which have each submitted their own Herceptin copy for approval by the EMA. The EMA's backing of Ontruzant also signals a new feat for Samsung Bioepisï'drug pipeline, as it is the firm's first cancer-targeting drug to be close to regulatory approval.Samsung has so far commercialized three biosimilar drugs in Europe, referencing Remicade, Enbrel and Humira. They are all anti-TNF therapies targeting autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.Friday's development also led local analysts to raise their target stock price for Samsung BioLogics, the parent company of Samsung Bioepis, on Monday. Shares of Samsung BioLogics hit an all-time high of 333,500 won ($300) before closing at 328,500 won on the day, up 0.61 percent from the previous trading day. ã€€Samsung Bioepis was founded in 2012 as a joint venture between contract drug manufacturer Samsung BioLogics and US drugmaker Biogen.

It was the third time the Seoul City Foreign Residents Council, consisting of 38 residents from 23 countries, held a general meeting since its launch in December 2015.Eleven policies were proposed, of which five were presented at the meeting. The proposals arose from the 11 meetings held this year separately by each division: human rights and cultural diversity, capacity building and improvement of living conditions.Taraki Mari, 27, from Switzerland proposed establishing prayer rooms for Muslims, who are obligated to pray five times a day at certain times of the day. She has been a resident here for seven years, and has found it difficult to practice her religion here.'There were times when I prayed at corners of the subway station or on the emergency staircase of a building,' she said according to a local newspaper. 'To reflect the growing Muslim population residing in Korea, I hope we can be respected as part of the community.'She also said, 'Establishment of prayer rooms will also give a good impression for Muslim tourists in Korea.'Proposals for improving living conditions included providing different foreign languages on maps and road signs as well as services at the multicultural family support center to foster cultural exchange and help foreign residents better adjust here.'I once got off at Itaewon Station to go to the Uzbekistan embassy, but I couldn't find any map or directions indicating its location. Even a few I found were only in Korean and English, blocking access to non-English-speaking foreigners,' a participant said.Other policies included easier access to earning drivers' licenses, using Noksapyeong Station on Line 6 as an exhibition hall showcasing different communities from around the world and subsidizing free subway access for long-term senior foreign residents.The council was established as an advisory body under the city government's Women and Family Policy Affairs division as a means to improve the quality of life for foreign residents here. As of 2015, there were 457,806 foreigners living in Seoul, up from 395,640 in 2013.Last year, 33 policies were proposed. The Seoul city government accepted 17 of those, including providing Korean language courses, educating migrant children in their native languages and including foreign languages in ads delivered to areas heavily populated by foreigners.'The policy proposals from the Foreign Residents Council are great examples of providing solutions through communication and collaboration,' said an official from the Women and Family Policy Affairs Office.

Now the tired U.S. is facing a young rival in China and a resurgent foe in Russia.LENGTH: 880 wordsThis US Navy handout photo obtained March 17, 2017 shows the guided-missile destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG 108) moored near the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) in Busan, Republic of Korea on March 16, 2017. / AFP-YonhapBy Oh Young-jinBruce Benett is a senior researcher at the Rand Corporation.The spooky-sounding Rand dates back to the height of the Cold War, helping prepare the United States for war or other contingencies. Dr. Bennett is a Korea expert and we should feel better off with some of his plans kept in the pigeonhole.So I was surprised to know he was speaking to a general audience, Tuesday.Without the extensive network of Park In-kook, the former ambassador to the United Nations, now leading the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies, which sponsored Bennett's lecture, the Rand man might have preferred to keep his 106th trip here low profile.I talked to him for about 20 minutes in a pre-lecture session.I told him that we had met 20-plus years ago. Then, I staked out Bennett to catch him on one of his trips to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a quote on a tip about a ROK-U.S. chemical warfare plan.'Do you remember Coral Reef'?' I asked him, referring to the codename for the operation. He remembered it.One thing led to another. Now, he talked about VX, the nerve agent that North Korea used to kill Kim Jong-nam, the estranged half-brother of its ruler Kim Jong-un.Bennett's revelation was that the North most likely conducted human trials to know that the agent was 25 times more lethal when applied to the face than on the hands. I told him that they had no problem of supply - the nation being one big gulag. We agreed that it should be another reason for Kim to stand trial on crimes against humanity.But what caught my attention was something he said twice in passing.'If the United States leaves, it won't come back' was his prediction, in the event that the U.S. and North Korea sign a peace treaty.I didn't have a chance to press on it with Bennett. But it is not hard to fathom his logic.It is related to China or more accurately the importance the Trump administration is placing on it to resolve the North's nuclear and missile challenges.At present, the Korean Peninsula is technically at war as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Then, the North and China on the one side, and the U.S. and U.N. forces on the other, signed up to it, while the Syngman Rhee government from the South wanted to unify the nation but when it didn't get its way, stayed away in protest.The North has long pushed for direct dialogue with the U.S. on a permanent peace, knowing that it would be the best security guarantee it can get from its 'main enemy.'But this is only half of its strategy. The first and conjunctive part of the Bennett statement - 'If the United States leaves' - captures the other half - its strategy of reunification.The peace treaty would leave the United States with little reason to keep its forces in the South. Once the U.S. is out, the North could invade and conquer the South.There are two precedents for the U.S. withdrawal. Washington declared the Acheson parameter setting its line of defense in Asia excluding South Korea. Less than six months later, on June 25, 1950, the North, backed by Chinese and Soviet forces, invaded the South.In Vietnam, also a flashpoint in the Cold War, the U.S.-backed South Vietnam was invaded and absorbed by the Communist North, soon after the U.S. withdrew after a peace treaty.So the question is how relevant these precedents are for the future.U.S. President Donald Trump is a key factor. Originally, he showed a strong disinclination to meddle in global affairs and wanted to disengage, although this tendency has relented lately.If his isolation streak comes back, one could never say 'never.'Another scenario is the possibility of a tradeoff - the North's promise to put a moratorium on or reduce its nuclear and missile development - in exchange for a peace treaty.Then, what is the validity of the second and conclusive part of Bennett's statement - 'it won't come back'?After the start of the North's 1950 invasion, the U.S. did come back with 15 other countries to the South's rescue. However, it didn't go back to rescue Saigon.The key difference was U.S. domestic politics - a strong anti-communist sentiment at the start of the Cold War, which preceded the Korean War, and an isolation bug escaped by a protracted war in Indochina.We can imagine what would happen, if Bennett's curse becomes a reality.It is time for us - presidential candidates included - to decide whether we want to find out about it.Bennett is a Cold-War warrior so his line of thought may be a bit confrontational by post-Cold War standards. But considering the confrontational rather than the conciliatory aspects of human nature, betting on the best intentions of the other party sounds dangerously naive.Lastly, I want to make clear Bennett didn't in any way show any spite to put Korea under a bad spell as the word 'curse' in the title indicates. Rather, it is my interpretation of his remarks, knowing that if realized, it could spell disaster.Oh Young-jin is The Korea Times' chief editorial writer.

'Those who are paid well will lose their jobs much faster than low-income earners.'Song, who also serves as the vice chairman of the Korea Business Intelligence Data Mining Society, is one of the nation's most renowned experts in big data analysis.He has tried to let the public know how big data will be used in the real world.'Data will allow machines to make their own decisions in the future,' he said. 'Doctors already trust in the Google search engine more than pharmacopoeia. In fact, a person's total amount of knowledge is not that big, compared to machines.'Although he predicted the emergence of the new sector of industry with a relatively lower cost-benefit ratio and higher complexity, he said it cannot eliminate unemployment, citing the Luddites in the 19th century as an example.'Textile workers and weavers in the 19th century were actually the high-income class, because of their skills,' he said. 'The new technology was immature, but offered low-cost products. The Luddites therefore lost their jobs, under the pressure of demand for price cuts.'He anticipated that skilled high-income workers in our era will be as unable to change their attitudes as the Luddites.'Individuals will lose their hegemony in the data world,' he said. 'Those who seize the hegemony will be systems, authorities, firms, organizations and people who own engines and data.'According to the vice president, sociologists and psychologists these days are eager to work for Facebook, because the global info-tech giant is holding an enormous amount of data.A few years ago, Facebook was embroiled in controversy, over allegations of conducting a secret psychological experiment on 700,000 users by manipulating their news feeds.Although the test was criticized by many, this case showed the company's leverage according to researchers.'Researchers have no choice but to envy Facebook's experiment for now,' Song said.In addition to the above-mentioned licensed professions, journalism is not an exception for jobs affected by big data, according to Song, who also delivers communication lectures at Korea University.He expected machines will write better straight news stories than people do.'Robots may outdo people in several areas of investigative reporting,' he said. 'For instance, when a baseball player throws a ball, machines will immediately come up with interesting data on the ball. That is impossible for a person.'He said journalists will be required to offer more evidence for their articles than before.'Most journalists have relied on the opinions of social media users and a few people on the street so far,' he said. 'Big data will change the scene. The public will want specific and objective evidence expressed in numbers.'Song was also confident of making content other than news articles through big data analysis.He mentioned House of Cards distributed by Netflix as an example.'Netflix is offering what viewers want,' he said. 'Big data will continue to be used as a tool to read the public's minds and thoughts.'Remaining hurdlesDespite the concerns, Song said Korean companies will have no choice but to use big data for their survival.'Because Korea has a small domestic demand and a high level of dependence on exports, companies should globalize themselves,' he said.According to the vice president, Korea is at an early stage of using big data.Local retailers, such as Shinsegae and Lotte, have just begun using big data, aiming to offer the most-preferred products to each customer.Recently, Lotte Confectionery even released new types of Pepero cookie sticks, by using an IBM Watson artificial intelligence (AI) agent's analysis of 10 million consumer reports posted on 80,000 websites regarding foods.Lotte Confectionery has become the country's first company that produced snacks using big data analysis.'Big data will be used in every sector of industry, just like water and gas,' Song said. 'It will enable businesses to optimize their use of resources.'However, Korea has yet to set up a system for training experts in big data analysis.A Korea Data Agency report last year showed that a third of Korean companies, which have yet to adopt big data, mentioned the lack of experts as the main reason for not using the technology. It also showed the country had 9,321 experts in big data analysis as of last year, but it still needs 6,451 additional experts by 2019.Against this backdrop, the government launched the Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but Song said proper compensation for achievements of the experts must be the top priority.'Talented students in Korea still want to be doctors and civil servants, because researchers are underpaid here,' he said. 'Will people like Demis Hassabis, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs be able to emerge in these circumstances?'Asked about controversies on the use of personal information for big data analysis, Song gave a simple answer.'Data is neutral,' he said. 'Technology itself does not cause problems, but people who deal with it can cause them.'Of course, the vice president understood Korean people's concerns on the theft of their personal information.'It is true that most people are traceable in Korea, because they use credit cards,' he said.However, he said partial deregulation of personal information will boost the economy.'I think the government can partially ease regulations on medical records for the sake of the health of humankind and welfare promotion. The records can also be used to develop new drugs,' he said. 'Actually, they will have to do so, because China, Japan and other rivals will do so.'Losing the global competition means death, he added.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERVIEWS (92%); BIG DATA (91%); LAYOFFS (90%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (89%); PSYCHOLOGY (89%); BUSINESS ANALYTICS (78%); COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS (78%); DATA MINING (78%); MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE (77%); SOCIOLOGY (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (76%); GARMENT WORKERS (76%); DISMISSALS (76%); POOR POPULATION (76%); FACTORY WORKERS (76%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (75%); UPPER INCOME PERSONS (74%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (69%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (65%); TEXTILES (64%); RESEARCH REPORTS (60%)COMPANY: GOOGLE INC (82%); FACEBOOK INC (52%)TICKER: FB (NASDAQ) (52%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (82%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (97%)LOAD-DATE: November 1, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

THE KOREA HERALD May 25, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDMay 25, 2017 ThursdayTech meets art in McGregor?s ?Atmos? LENGTH: 513 wordsHow can modern-day technology be integrated into art? According to decorated choreographer Wayne McGregor, the mix of science and art can be quite ??poetic.????We??re interested in technology, not necessarily on stage, but a way it??s inspiring process,?? said McGregor while explaining the production of his show ??Atmos,?? which is set to be performed at LG Arts Center in southern Seoul on Friday and Saturday. During the press conference on Thursday, McGregor said he and other artists at Company Wayne McGregor have drawn from wide spectrum of sources -- from cognitive neuro-science to anthropology -- as inspiration for movement. ??We often work with AI, machine learning or new technological ways of working in studio, to inspire the body -- in some way -- to ??misbehave.?? We??re interested in the body doing things out of the normal way of working,?? he said, adding that he looks to ??subvert?? normal way of dancing to create a ??different kind of physical language.?? McGregor said that his curiosity toward atomizing the human body had triggered the show??s production, first performed at Sadler??s Wells Theatre in London in 2013. According to the choreographer, the show was inspired by 1982 neo-noir science fiction film ??Blade Runner,?? which explores the ethics involving technological development. The production staff had divided the movie into 1,200 pieces and reinterpreted them to form various movements, with which McGregor and his dancers expanded upon. While not re-enacting elements of the cult classic, McGregor??s work borrows themes and motions from the movie.An essential part of the production was an artificial creature, which he said was like the show??s ??11th artificial dancer.????It (artificial dancer) hijacks the moments from ??Blade Runner?? and it tries to recreate the motion that was in that tiny little ??atom?? of movement. And soon as it gets close to the motion of the atom, it evaporates and does something else,?? he said. McGregor added that he did not feel that it was necessary for the dancer to be actually shown on stage, ??Hardware just inspires different ways of generating content, makes us think differently about how we can integrate the technology,?? he said. The dancer??s costumes were designed by the Studio XO, which had collected the data on the physical attributes of each dancer through its wearable technology and applied it to each costume. The music was done by ambient music duo A Winged Victory for the Sullen, which McGregor said would ??take you to another world?? in a different kind of sensory experience. Atmos is also known for demonstrating 3-D graphics on stage, designed by artist Ravi Deepres. Its Seoul performance was part of British Council??s ??UK/Korea 2017-18?? program that will bring the UK??s latest arts and creative projects here. The show will be held 8 p.m. Friday and 5 p.m. Saturday at LG Arts Center in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and tickets range from 40,000 won to 80,000 won.For more information, call (02) 2005-0114 or visit www.lgart.com.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CHOREOGRAPHY (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); DANCE (90%); COSTUME & SET DESIGN (89%); DANCERS (89%); FILM (89%); WEARABLE COMPUTERS (78%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (78%); NEUROSCIENCE (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (75%); WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY (73%); SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY FILMS (66%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (60%); PRESS CONFERENCES (56%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (55%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (55%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (87%)LOAD-DATE: May 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

'Today, K-Arts has raised its international standing as an arts school with a remarkable track-record.'K-Arts ranked 46th in the performing arts category of the 2016 QS World University Rankings based on its academic and industrial reputation.The art school has 27 departments in six schools - Music; Drama; Film, TV and Multimedia; Dance; Visual Arts; and Korean Traditional Arts.'While our students had dreamed of becoming star artists, now they should aim to become master artists who can create classics with Korean style beauty that remains for centuries,' Kim said.Kim cited examples of Kim Jeong-hui (1786-1856), a calligrapher and scholar of the Joseon Kingdom, and pioneering video artist Paik Nam-june who passed away in 2006.'We have been encouraging our students to create their own art by building on their creative power and originality,' Kim said.For this, the school launched a project called K-Arts Platform Project in 2013 in which students make and share their artworks through various exhibits and performances.'The university spares no expense and effort in providing abundant materials and facilities capable of fulfilling the students' desire for the arts, as well as offering various opportunities for students to showcase their work,' Kim said.The school has held a festival every September since 2015 to showcase the best artwork created through the project.'Many industry insiders are interested in our students' works and some even buy them,' Kim said.K-Arts also financially supports its students to participate in international competitions. In 2016, the school provided about 65 million won ($56,700) to 37 talented students.One of three campuses of the Korea National University of Arts (K-Arts) in Seongbuk-gu, northern Seoul / Courtesy of K-ArtsFamous alumniWith the school's support, K-Arts alumni have won national and international awards while achieving good performances in domestic and international competitions.A recent example is Kim Ki-min, 24, a principal dancer at Russia's Mariinsky Ballet, a world-class ballet troupe, who won the top ballerina prize at the 2016 Benois de la Danse, known as the 'Oscars of ballet.' This was the first time for a Korean or Asian ballerina received the prize.As of 2016, the number of prizes K-Arts alumni had been awarded is tallied at 3,107, of which 906 are first prize. The arts school was established by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 1992 with the motto, 'Practical training based arts education.'Trained under the school's creative and practical classes, many alumni as well as those attending the school are actively engaged in a variety of arts fields.'Our students have been regarded as professionals who can work in the field right away, not amateurs,' Kim said. He cited an example of a movie director Na Hong-jin, whose previous works include the 2008 hit film 'The Chaser' and last year's ""Goksung.''Na made a name for himself through his works while attending the school,' Kim said.Leading hallyuIn line with its goal to create classics in the future, Kim vowed to strengthen pure arts, which he also believes can continue hallyu, or the Korean wave.'It is often said that the reason why Korea has never received a Nobel Prize in science is a lack of investment in pure science,' Kim said. 'In the same vein, current hallyu, typified by K-pop fever, is commercialized too much; it is time to create new killer hallyu content.'Kim was proud that one of K-Arts students created the cartoon character Pororo, a little penguin that wears orange glasses and a yellow hat, which is popular among kids in Korean and abroad.'I hope our alumni can contribute to keeping hallyu going with their creative content,' Kim said.The president also stressed the importance of increasing diversity to enhance pure arts.Under such a belief, the school launched a program called Art Major Asian Scholarship (AMA) in 2005 to invite artists from developing countries and provide them with high quality art education.'Many AMA alumni are leaders in the culture and art sectors after returning to their home countries,' Kim said. The number of AMA alumni stands at 145.Successful cases include Abu Shahed Emon who graduated from the filmmaking department of the School of Film, TV and Multimedia in 2015 and has become a famous film director in Bangladesh.Another example is Him Sotithya who also graduated from the filmmaking department at K-Arts in 2010 and now serves as vice dean at The Royal University of Fine Arts in Cambodia.'Through these kinds of programs, I believe that the school will become an arts hub that spreads Korean arts to the world,' Kim added.Expanding international exchangesIn another effort to increase diversity, the president has committed to expand international exchanges.The art school has created partnerships with 113 foreign universities of arts in 37 countries. They include the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Russia, Hannover University for Music and Drama in Germany, Conservatoire de Paris in France and University of the Arts London in the U.K.'We are also making efforts to promote exchanges with many selected Chinese universities to help our students make inroads into Chinese market and give them various opportunities,' Kim said.K-Arts has close relationships with 10 Chinese art colleges including the Communication University of China, the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Shanghai Theatre Academy.K-Arts has been running an exchange program called Collective Action for Mobility Program of University Students in Asia with partner schools.This year, it plans to open a course in which students from Korea, China and Japan work together to create international animation.'We also plan to launch a project called the Cultural Olympics before August in which students from the three countries deliver performances, and hold exhibitions and workshops in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo,' Kim said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (92%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (90%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); DANCERS (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); BALLET (89%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (89%); DANCE (89%); VISUAL ARTS (78%); DANCE COMPANIES (78%); STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS (78%); FILM (78%); VISUAL ARTISTS (78%); ART HISTORY (77%); HISTORY (75%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (50%)LOAD-DATE: February 8, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"407","[Herald Design Forum 2017] Architects share their design philosophy with youths",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"November","[Herald Design Forum 2017] Architects share their design philosophy with youths   THE KOREA HERALD November 7, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDNovember 7, 2017 Tuesday[Herald Design Forum 2017] Architects share their design philosophy with youths LENGTH: 689 wordsRenowned architects shared their design philosophy during a session of the Herald Design Forum 2017 that took place on Tuesday under the slogan 'Design for Humanity' in Seoul. The first speaker for Herald X Dgit was Carme Pigem, a Spanish architect and member of the Pritzker Prize-winning architectural firm RCR Arquitectes. A main design philosophy of her firm is harmony among the building, the site and the environment, according to Pigem.'For us, understanding a site is very important as the site itself can be an important source,' Carme Pigem said. Pigem said when her firm designs a new building, they first consider the place's unique condition and atmosphere.'We see the site and the environment first and think about what we can make to have a connection with the place. We try not to separate the existing place with a new building,ï'she said. 'Although it may sound a bit abstract, I believe it can be applied into all architecture.ï'She presented diverse projects showing how they could design a building by being in harmony with nature and the environment.She presented her past project, a multipurpose building called Les Cols, where they had left the existing house as it was found with the aim of retaining the existing environment and being in harmony with the new building. Asked what materials her firm uses the most, she said, 'We try to use only one material or one color for one place. If we use too many materials and colors, it will only harm the unique identity of the place.'The next presenter was Korean architect Wee Jin-bok, who highlighted the importance of engineering and rebuilding social relations for design. He said architects should consider projects from the perspective of engineering in an extreme environment such as an earthquake and typhoon. 'When we went to the Philippines in 2013, a huge typhoon had left Tacloban city devastated. Some volunteers from non-government organizations came and built shelters all connected with each other on the ground of increasing collective resistance. It was the wrong idea because the connectivity will only make ventilation difficult and humid,ï'he said. He also mentioned the rebuilding of social relations as another role of design. 'In Korea, the word 'designï'is used as decorating something beautiful. However, from the perspective of architects, design should serve to rebuild social relations,ï'Wee said. He presented his past project as an example of how design can rebuild social relations. 'There are more than 400 community service centers in Seoul that operate from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. We wanted to use the empty space at night for citizens to forge bonds. We created a theater outside the center for people to gather,ï'he said. With the theater drawing more residents at night, communication among neighbors increased and the crime rate went down, he said. Architect Baek Hee-sung, the head of KEAB, stressed the importance of one's memory in designing a building. He said history is the past which many people share in common but memory is something that only individuals can have.He presented an ongoing building project in Saejongdaero, Seoul that was made by a touch of numerous citizens. 'We let people write what they want on a computer, print them out, put them in a box and insert each box into the wall of the building. When the walls are full of the message boxes, this building will be full of memories of people,ï'he said. Another project his firm did was 'Hanriver Memory Galleryï'that is now floating on the Han River with the aim of recovering the memory of sandy beaches.'Not many young people know that we had five sandy beaches at Han River decades ago. So we built Hanriver Memory Gallery on Han River. Inside the gallery, we created an environment where people can get a beach-like experience,ï'he said.'We found many people feeling sorry about losing nature and hoping that urban development may not harm our nature and traditional culture.ï'By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARCHITECTURE (91%); ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES (90%); ENGINEERING (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (71%); TYPHOONS (67%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); PHILIPPINES (79%)LOAD-DATE: November 7, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

We edited these letters to allow more of them to be published. Also we decided not to reveal the last names of those making the contributions. For those who want to participate in the discussion, go to http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/opinion/2017/06/667-230509.html. - ED.Let's not embrace ¡®get even with'The case you make is noted. Commiseration is in order.However, it seems that all concerned (past and present) have thrown the word ""forgiveness"" out of their vocabulary.Furthermore, all countries have committed and suffered shameful history, atrocities, misdeeds and tragedies. All people have been victims at one point in history.I don't say forget about the past, however, I do not embrace 'getting even with.'When responsible countries and governments do not do what they ought to do to correct their treatment (and all it entails) of citizens during colonization or war, etc., then, it is the duty and obligation of the mistreated people's government to compensate and assuage their citizen victims.Constructing memorial statues I do support very much, however, erecting them in front of the offices of a diplomatic residence is simply wrong and has led to only more friction.I feel that it is governments that continue the strife between nations. Most countries' citizens harbor no ill-feeling toward other peoples. And, yes, the newer generations have no interest in the past; they wish to move forward.For example, I have no wish to fight the Civil War again. I'm an old Southern Rebel at heart; I don't much care for most Yankees, but I will not get in their face about the past events. Besides, if we were not there on the spot at the time, then you can best bet that provided stories from both sides have been embellished or left out a fact or two.WilliamWe did suffer like KoreaIndonesia, Southeast Asia. I would like to offer some views after reading your article titled 'Holocaust vs. comfort women' yesterday.I assume you already know about Japan's colonization of Indonesia soil in the 1940s. We had comfort women or 'jugun-ianfu.'I think Indonesians would have the same opinion as yours. The Holocaust was a tragedy but the comfort woman phenomenon was as well. Both were abuse of humanity.And about education, I think we should raise our awareness about history too, and see it as clearly as possible, as the way it is. To make the future as it should be.I do not say that Indonesian government is like a saint, we go through our difficult times, too, after declaring independence.My ancestors had avoided being as comfort women since they lived in the mountains, but my great grandpa still did 'romusha' or hard labor.In my opinion, I forgive what Japan's military did, but I never forget about it. Not because I am could not fully forgive but because I would take it as a reminder. So, we should never allow the same thing to happen again in the future.Anyway, I should praise you for writing on such a sensitive theme.VinyIt's numbers - 6 mil. vs. 200,000It is about numbers, it is also about intent and it is about what happened. If you think all bad things are the same simply because they are bad, you're wrong. Systematically rounding up people for the sole intent of killing them and wiping their ""race"" out is the absolute worst thing human beings have ever done.. The Mongols raped one quarter of the women on the planet but that wasn't the worst thing they did. Killing 50 million people was. Being killed is worse than being forced to have sex. Killing 600,000 is a lot worse than 200,000 being raped. Are they both bad? Yes.JasonEast Asian brothel cultureOne egregious problem with equating the Koreans' status as victims of the Japanese with the Jews vs. Germany is that millions on Koreans participated in the colonial project, including in the dark act of procuring the comfort women. It also overlooks the context that selling daughters into prostitution was very common practice in traditional East Asian societies.Japanese denial of this and other war crimes is a very serious issue, but Mr. Oh does his own cause a great disservice by this continued poorly articulated false equivalence.ChristopherHarping on comfort women ad nauseumThis op-ed piece does not reflect the majority opinion of most educated Koreans and is at best self-righteously hypocritical, anti-Semitic, if not totally distorted. This individual's inflammatory rhetoric, specifically that ""We [Korea] will make peace with Japan, when you [Arabs] make your peace with Israel"" is patently ridiculous as it belies the fact that Korea is not currently, nor has it been lately (for the past 500 years or so), in an actual state of war with Japan, as Japan has NOT been our foe for quite some time now.Also, to keep on harping on the ""Comfort Women"" issue and Japan's complicity, ad nauseum, is totally hypocritical recognizing the fact that successive regimes from Park Chung-hee, to as recently as the late 1990s, implemented, maintain and upheld a similar system of providing ""Comfort Women"" - i.e., legal prostitution in organized brothels - catering specifically to U.S. troops based in Korea. This system of regulated prostitution catering to U.S. servicemen in various shanty towns and villages adjacent to USFK bases worked hand-in-hand with the Korean government for decades, with concomitant VD checks, medical exams for prostitutes in a system of de facto indentured servitude that would make the Imperial Japanese Army, circa 1944, blush.The writer doesn't get to lambast an entire nation and put foreign relations with an important economic ally in peril. The fact is that with only a handful of surviving comfort women left over from the occupation era, the rest of the world has - not surprisingly - moved on. Instead of harping on those things that cannot be changed, we need to bring attention to the sins and misdeeds of our own government, whose complicity in creating Korea's own cold-war era Comfort Women system has been totally neglected by the Korean government as the victims of that era continue to wither away in obscurity and poverty.JulieHolocaust is exaggeratedThe Holocaust (6 million were gassed in the camps of the Germans) story is not true. First, the 6 million figure is not true: an Auschwitz memorial plaque revised the 4 million killed down to 1 million killed (and this is still not correct), and the gassing story is not true either.The only gassing that took place in the camps was to kill the lice that caused typhus. Gassing was a life-saving measure, not a homicidal one.After release, former camp inmates passed around stories initially that they were executed with electric machines. Other stories passed around were prisoners were executed by brain-bashing machines (operated by pedals), by being thrown into lime pits to be killed by acid and dissolved, by masturbation machines and even by atomic devices. Then they said they were executed by gassings that took place in shower rooms.This story, unlike the others, took hold and came to be widely quoted, and evolved into the familiar Holocaust story that we know today. However, none of the shower rooms in the camps show Prussian blue (cyanide residues), which would have to be present for the gassing stories to be true.The only places where Prussian blue staining shows up is in small fumigation cubicles that contained clothing racks where the clothes and other personal belongings of prisoners were treated with cyanide gas to kill lice that caused typhus, a major killer of people in the first half of the 20th century (and earlier). Another name for typhus is ""jail fever"" and ""camp fever"". The use of cyanide gas as a disinfectant to fumigate clothes and personal belongings was the standard treatment for kill lice and prevent typhus epidemics in Europe at that time.YvetteNo tolerance for divisive religionsI have zero sympathy for Jews, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the rest of these hate-filled religions, who have rained down upon humanity unending wars and suffering. Let's not forget Hitler only capitalized on long-simmering resentment caused by Jewish hegemony in the economic condition from WWI and earlier. Hitler was not a one-time event.CarlosKorea is not currently at war, cold or otherwise with Japan, whereas Israel is currently committing atrocities in the Middle East. Israel does not equal all Jews, by the way. It's possible to be Jewish, not Israeli and still be appalled at what is happening there. If you published this article in a Western country, any Western country, you would be out of a job by the end of the day.You start off describing what I assume to be a Westerner's opinion, segue into what people in The Middle East think and then start talking about how Westerners need to be educated about Korean suffering. The world is aware of the Holocaust. The world is also aware of comfort women, Unit 731, the Armenian genocide, Pol Pot's Killing Fields, Stalin's purges and all the other sickening, terrible things that have happened in our recent history. We do not denigrate the victims of atrocities in order to push our own agendas. We do not treat remembrance as a commodity. We do not try to depreciate victims of the Holocaust in order to inflate the suffering of Koreans under Japan.MatthewLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); SLAVERY (78%); CIVIL WAR (73%)COMPANY: FACEBOOK INC (58%)TICKER: FB (NASDAQ) (58%)INDUSTRY: NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (58%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (93%); INDONESIA (92%); SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA (79%); JAPAN (79%); ASIA (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Many experts believe the process of learning English is too stressful and less effective for young children.' said Kwon Ji-young, a director of early childhood education, at the MOE. 'Secondly, English will be provided in classes starting in the 3rd grade, so English classes before this only become early preparation for elementary school.'A daycare enforcement regulation under the Ministry of Health and Welfare allows foreign language classes to be taught at daycare centers. However, the government is now aiming to make changes.'An enforcement regulation at the ministry allows foreign language classes after school; we need to get rid of it,' said Kwon Byung-ki, a director of the division of childcare policy at the ministry.'Since it's not law, all we need is the minister's approval to take out the enforcement regulation.'The ministries are both onboard to ban English classes at daycare centers and a final decision is expected to be made within the month.There are around 40,000 daycare centers in Korea and 70 percent are members of the Korea Edu-care Association (KEA), which are strongly opposed to the ban.'Banning the classes overall without the consent of parents or their views is absurd. We are against the move.' said Ryu Ho-young, a manager at (KEA) 'We are scheduled to open a board of directors meeting Jan. 11 to come up with countermeasures.'Many parents are worried that the ban will leave them no choice, but to put their children through private education.'Even with the government ban on English classes, there is a good chance parents might consider sending their kids through private education, because most parents believe English is an important factor for them.' said Choi Sun-hee a teacher at a daycare center in Seoul.Many experts are worried the ban could cause a balloon effect toward private education as more parents might choose this as an alternate option.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIMARY SCHOOLS (92%); CHILDREN (90%); AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS (90%); EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); CHILD CARE (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); PARENTS (89%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (89%); PARENTING (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (71%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (69%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 8, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Our neighbor also halted talks on a bilateral currency swap agreement with Seoul. In his NHK interview, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged South Korea to show sincerity in implementing the ""comfort women"" agreement reached in late 2015.We are speechless with the nonsensical reality that the assailants who committed a crime against humanity chide the victims.China has been hell-bent on retaliating in response to Seoul's decision to host a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system here. The country with the world's second-largest economy admitted this last week when a group of opposition lawmakers visited.We cannot but feel the arrogance of a neighboring superpower, which has cut off all official channels and is trying to inflame our internal schism by rolling out the red carpet for our senseless lawmakers.The Trump administration's inauguration next week will also produce formidable challenges. Even at this moment, it is hard to know what his policies on the Korean Peninsula will be. Given that during his campaign the president-elect asked Seoul to pay more to keep American troops here, our anxiety is growing.The magnitude of diplomatic challenges facing Korea is serious indeed amid a leadership vacuum caused by the parliamentary impeachment of President Park Geun-hye.But a bigger problem is that parties and presidential hopefuls are competing fiercely to overturn sensitive diplomatic agreements even at the risk of hurting our alliance with Washington.Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, claims Seoul should return the 1 billion yen it received from Japan and nullify the comfort women accord, and most opposition contenders support his argument.The opposition parties also call for shelving the THAAD deployment or withdrawing its agreement, citing China's retaliation.But it is hard to know what the backlash might be. Trump, who sees all relations as deals, might want to pull U.S. servicemen out of the peninsula. Especially on the THHAD issue, there is fear that Seoul will set a bad precedent of yielding to Beijing's pressure, let alone damage the Seoul-Washington alliance.One of the most important principles in diplomacy is consistency. Unless this is upheld, nations cannot trust each other. There is no doubt that agreements must be honored.All this requires our presidential runners to be more prudent and cool-headed about security and diplomatic issues. A fundamental change of policy direction must come following a significant policy review after taking power.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); AGREEMENTS (90%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (79%); HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (77%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (77%); POLITICS (76%); PRIME MINISTERS (76%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (74%); NATIONAL SECURITY (73%); SLAVERY (72%); SWAP TRANSACTIONS (71%); POLITICAL PARTIES (65%); IMPEACHMENT (65%); ARMED FORCES (64%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%); SHINZO ABE (79%); DONALD TRUMP (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); PUSAN, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); TOKYO, JAPAN (73%); BEIJING, CHINA (56%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (56%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (92%)LOAD-DATE: January 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The company plans to begin selling the drug in Korea after selecting a marketing partner and completing drug pricing procedures, it said. Herceptin is among Roche's topselling biologic drugs. It generated worldwide sales of around $6.78 billion won last year for the Swiss pharmaceutical giant.Samsung Bioepis has filed its Herceptin biosimilar for regulatory approval in Europe, and is currently awaiting a decision from the European Medicines Agency.Korea has so far approved three other biosimilars made by Samsung Bioepis, each referencing Enbrel, Remicade and Humira, which are all anti-TNF drugs targeting autoimmune diseases. Samsung is already selling its biosimilars referencing Enbrel and Remicade in Korea via its local marketing partner Yuhan Corp. It is slated to launch its Humra-referencing biosimilar here after its Korean patent expires in January 2019.Samsung also sells its Enbrel biosimilar in Europe and its Remicade biosimilar in Europe and the US. Its Humira biosimilar was approved in Europe this year as well. Headquartered in Songdo of Incheon, Samsung Bioepis specializes in the development of biosimilars, cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs whose patents have expired.

Serious plans are now underway to put two space tourists in a commercially launched rocket that will circle the moon in a year or two.Meanwhile, NASA continues its plans to put humans on Mars in the late 2020s or early 2030s. China and India have also announced plans for manned expeditions to the moon, with Mars as an eventual possibility too, later in this century.These are all ambitious missions that should excite everyone who believes it is humanity's destiny to explore the frontiers of space. But as ambitious as these plans may be, they are dwarfed in scope by the United Arab Emirates' plan for the next century.One of the world's richest nations announced that it is planning to build a glistening city on Mars fit for habitation by 2117, a century from now. UAE engineers have already unveiled plans for a city the size of Chicago. The tiny oil kingdom is also rolling out scientific programs meant to create the kind of generational interest in space exploration needed to keep the effort vital and rooted. They would like scientific innovation and know-how in space to take the place of petroleum as its greatest export.The initial leg of UAE's plan begins with the launch of its first Martian probe in 2021. The Emirates plan to take the century-long march methodically given the obstacles that await humanity as we take our first steps beyond the moon.

Event program manager Lucien Giordano said IACAC was 'ecstatic' about hosting it in South Korea.'It is a great opportunity to learn firsthand from over 40 universities representing over a dozen countries.'British universities may find themselves outnumbered by the 22 U.S. universities expected to attend.Jeremy Burgess, deputy director of student recruitment at Nottingham University, said he was 'super-excited' about his first visit to South Korea.Burgess, who will give two presentations at the Incheon event, said: 'Part of the joy of this job is that you get to travel and be exposed to different cultures.'Burgess praised South Korean students' contribution to British university life: 'Having people from a diverse range of backgrounds helps to cultivate the intellectual landscape.'Nottingham University has a well-established exchange agreement with Seoul's Korea University.Jessica Reeves, the senior international relations manager who leads on South Korea, said students from Yonsei, Ewha and Sookmyung universities sometimes came to Nottingham for a semester or a year.'One of the most popular subjects for Korean students is creative arts and creative subjects,' Reeves said.The University of the Arts, London, is Britain's leading recruiter of South Korean students, according to the United Kingdom's Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA ), Burgess said, while Nottingham University ranks 19th.But the 2016-17 academic year saw 25 Korean students enrolled at Nottingham, a rise on the previous year.Reeves said South Korean students at Nottingham University were studying subjects including economics, sociology and education.She said Nottingham University student Gang Hye-rim had started a Korean-language blog on Naver, South Korea's biggest portal, while serving as a university intern.Reeves said the blog provided 'a student's perspective on Nottingham life,' mixing academic and fun content, and contrasting British and South Korean office life.Shin Gyong-gu, former dean of the international office at Chonnam National University (2008-12), said South Korean students had a 'clear preference' for U.S. universities.But he said South Korean students were too 'narrowly oriented' toward America and might learn more from European and British universities.Reeves, who has visited South Korea twice annually for three-and-a-half years, said: 'I've had a fantastic experience working in South Korea.'She said she had found people 'pleasant, friendly, polite,' South Korean society 'efficient,' and the cuisine 'amazing' -- especially barbecue dishes.Jacob Lotinga is a contributor to The Korea Times.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); COLLEGE STUDENTS (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (76%); APPRENTICESHIPS & INTERNSHIPS (74%); ACADEMIC ADMISSIONS (73%); ACADEMIC COUNSELING (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); SOCIOLOGY (61%); AGREEMENTS (50%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF UTAH (57%)CITY: NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND (96%); INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); LONDON, ENGLAND (58%)STATE: UTAH, USA (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (99%); ENGLAND (96%); ASIA (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); EASTERN ASIA (90%); SOUTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: August 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Now, there are 37.On July 23, Kim Kun-ja, who was forcibly taken to frontline military brothels to serve Japanese soldiers during World War II, died at a shelter for 'comfort women,' a euphemism for such victims. She was 91.For Jo Yong-joo and Ha Joo-young, who have been cycling from Los Angeles to New York to raise awareness of the issue in the United States, it was heartbreaking news and a reminder that there is not much time left.One of their objectives is to urge U.S. politicians, including President Donald Trump, to join international efforts to convince the Japanese government to apologize to the survivors before it is too late.The name of their project is Triple A, which stands for 'admit, apologize and accompany.' They call on the Japanese government to admit to its past wrongdoings toward the women and apologize to them.'Until then, we will encourage everyone to accompany the women in their fight for justice. That's what it means,' Jo said in an interview.Jo believes it is an issue of human rights rather than a diplomatic one. 'In addition to Korea, young women from China, the Philippines, the Netherlands and many other countries were victimized. This is why I think it should be called a crime against humanity,' he said.During their ride, they staged demonstrations in front of the Japanese consulates in several major cities, including Chicago and Philadelphia, in support of the 'Wednesday Demonstration,' which has held outside of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul every week since January 1992.Along the way, they've also talked to many journalists and anyone else they met. Some were impressed by what they do and gave them support, while others showed little interest. Altogether, it was a great learning experience for them.'At some point, we decided to give up our businesslike approach and tried more to mingle with people in conveying our message,' Jo said.The journey has been rough for the students, who encountered various challenges, such as scorching desert heat, storms and headwinds.'It was really tough in the beginning, but we became more and more used to cycling,' he noted.But it was also a beautiful ride. 'We had the most breathtaking view on a mountain in New Mexico. It was totally worth hours of our effort to reach the top,' Ha said.They are expecting a similar sense of achievement early next month at the end of their trip in New York City.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (89%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (88%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (78%); WOMEN (77%); SLAVERY (77%); INTERVIEWS (73%); WORLD WAR II (72%); HUMAN RIGHTS (72%); ARMED FORCES (71%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (79%)CITY: NEW YORK, NY, USA (92%); LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%)STATE: NEW YORK, USA (92%); NEW MEXICO, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%)COUNTRY: JAPAN (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); NETHERLANDS (79%); CHINA (79%); PHILIPPINES (79%)LOAD-DATE: August 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Then there was Anthony Weiner, who risked his marriage and destroyed his reputation by sexting nude photos of himself to numerous women, at least one of them underage.Now, there is another marital scandal rocking the political world.Vice President Mike Pence, we have learned, will not dine alone with a woman not his wife! And he won't attend any events where alcohol is served unless his wife is also present!Oh, the humanity.Pence actually made those remarks in a 2002 interview, but they went largely unnoticed since he was a mere congressman at the time. But a Washington Post reporter doing a feature recently on Mrs. Karen Pence did a tweet of them as a promotion of the feature, and social media just exploded.To those on the left, this was blatant paternalistic sexism on Pence's part. He objectifies women as nothing more than temptations that men must avoid. Furthermore, he doesn't have a very high opinion of men, either, if he thinks they can be so easily led astray. His unequal treatment of women is discriminatory and possibly illegal. If he won't be alone with women, that means he won't give them an equal shot at the best jobs.To those on the right, Pence is to be commended for trying to ""build a zone"" of respect around his marriage. He is showing strength of character not to put himself in temptation's way or to even give the appearance of impropriety. If more marriages were treated the way the Pences treat theirs, this would be a much better country.Really, how divided have we become that we can be at each other's throats over something this personal?The truth is, the Pences are evangelical Christians, and this rule is practiced (or at least preached) a lot in those circles, so this is nothing outlandish; evangelicals make up about 25 percent of the country.If this were, say, a rule set and followed by an extremely devout Muslim man, wouldn't there be calls to tolerate and respect his religious beliefs?

"420","Luc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","Luc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual   THE KOREA HERALD August 23, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 23, 2017 WednesdayLuc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual LENGTH: 626 wordsIconic French director Luc Besson??s recent film ??Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?? showcases his own brand of space adventure, but the epic sci-fi flick ultimately aims to deliver a message of diversity and humanity, the director says.??I??m sorry to be so naive and not cynical, but I think if we put money first and humans second, we are all going to go to war and die,?? said the acclaimed filmmaker, best known here for ??Leon: The Professional?? (1994), ??The Fifth Element?? (1997) and ??Taxi?? (1998), at a press conference at CGV Yongsan in Seoul, Tuesday. ???Valerian,?? available in 3-D, is set in the 28th century in a universe where species from all corners of space have come together to build Alpha, a sort of galactic capital. They live in harmony there, exchanging knowledge and culture. Dane DeHaan stars as the space federation??s police agent Valerian, while Cara Delevingne plays fellow cop and partner Larueline. The two set out on a mission to retrieve a rare treasure, and uncover the secret behind the destruction of a planet and species. ? ??I met Dane and after a few minutes, I knew he would be Valerian.??Besson said he made model-turned-actress Delevingne jump through various hoops for the role. ??She didn??t used (to act) so much before so I made her work. I tortured her, because I needed to know if she has something inside, something real. And I discovered she has a lot. She is a natural born actress.???The endeavor was something Besson had been imagining for several years. But the $180 million project, brimming with worlds created with computer graphics, creatures and vehicle rides through space was not so simple to execute. ??The technology was ready after ??Avatar,?? which made everything possible,?? he said, referring to James Cameron??s 2009 sci-fi that pioneered the use of new 3-D filming techniques. Besson??s ??Valerian?? is a remake of well-known French comics ??Valerian and Laureline?? from 1967 which influenced on future sci-fi stories, including the ??Star Wars?? series. In order to recreate and expand on the world of the comics, Besson toured the world and handpicked 12 designers.??First year, I don??t even give them the script because I don??t want them to be limited. I??d say ??28th century, let??s go, guys. Go everywhere.?? They came back with 6,000 drawings of the craziest things I??ve seen in my life -- the craziest creatures, spaceships, systems.?? ? Besson describes ??Valerian?? as a ??fun?? film with humor and relatable characters.??It??s not a huge drama where the hero lost his mother. It??s a fun film. ... By the way, the hero is a bit stupid and pretentious. So he??s like us. The real hero is the girl, as usual. Because in life, we all know that the woman is ruling the house.?? Most Hollywood sci-fi flicks these days tend to offer bleak depictions of our future world, Besson pointed out.???The aliens are coming to destroy everything and aliens get punished. I??m not saying I??m against it, I??m reacting to it.?????Valerian?? presents a world where ??all the aliens are friendly,?? he said. ??We can shake their hands. The villains are us, as usual.??An ambitious opera of fantastical creatures and settings, ??Valerian?? hopes to stoke the imagination of adults.??When we??re young we??re able to dream. When you grow up you become more pragmatic, more cynical. ... So the film is about that. The film is unusual. It??s different because I wanted to remind adults (of) the power of dreaming. Even for adults I think the film is a good medic, a pill.???Commercially, the high-budgeted film is shaping up to be a flop in North America and Europe, where it opened earlier. ??Valerian?? is set to hit local theaters on Aug. 29.

"421","Pilgrimage to remember poet Yun Dong-ju",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"September","Pilgrimage to remember poet Yun Dong-ju  Korea Times September 22, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesSeptember 22, 2017 FridayPilgrimage to remember poet Yun Dong-juBYLINE: By Choi Yearn-hongLENGTH: 1974 wordsChoi Yearn-hong poses in front of poet Yun Dong-ju's gravestone in Jilin Province, China.Poet Yun Dong-ju / Korea Times fileYun Dong-ju is one of the most revered Korean poets in modern history, as many opinion polls have indicated. He was born on Dec. 30, 1917, and died in a Fukuoka prison during his study at Doshisha University. In commemoration of Yun's centennial year, the Korean Writers' Association organized a trip to trace Yun Dong-ju's life, from his birth at Myungdong Village in North Kando, Manchuria, to his college life at Rikkyo University in Tokyo and Doshisha University in Kyoto and to his time at a Fukuoka prison, where he died on February 1945, before the Liberation of Korea on August 1945. After the 10-day trip, the group visited Yonsei University, where he completed his undergraduate education.He produced his 10 most memorable poems at Yonsei University and wrote five more poems in Tokyo. His poems from Kyoto are not available, as the Japanese police confiscated his intellectual properties. Since my middle school days, I have read his poems and learned more about him at Yonsei University, when I took a couple of courses under the late professor Chang Duk-soon at the Korean literature department and the late professor Yun Young-choon at the Divinity School. Chang grew up together with Yun Young-choon in Yong-jung, and Yun Young-choon was Yun's uncle. Yun's poem, 'Star-counting Night,' was my favorite poem in my youth. I was lonely in my middle school in Seoul, and I missed my mother often. This poem comforted me then and now.I translated Yun's major poems into English, including four poems in this essay.¡®Star-counting Night'The sky witnessing the change of seasons is filled with autumn.Therefore, I can count all the stars in autumn without any worry.Yet the reasons I cannot count all the stars engraved in my heart is thatThe morning arrives too early,Tomorrow night is waiting for me,And I still have my youth left.One star for my memoryOne star for my loveOne star for my lonelinessOne star for my longingOne star for my painOne star for my poemsOne star for my mother, my mother.Mother, I call out one beautiful word per star.Like the names of my elementary school classmates who shared a desk.The names of foreign girls such as Pae, Kyung, Ok.The names of girls who must have become mothers.The names of my poor neighbors, pigeon, puppy, rabbit, mule.And the names of poets like Frances Jammes and Rainer Maria Rilke.They are all very far away from me.Just like the stars are very far away.Mother,You are far away from me in Bukkando.Yearning for something I write my name on the hill where much star-light shines.And then I cover it with dirt.The reason why crickets are crying every night is thatThey are distressed over their shameful name.Yet when winter has gone and spring returns even to my starLike pride, plants will grow luxuriously over the hill where my name lies buriedJust like green grass grows back on the grave.Our 26-person pilgrimage started on Sept. 1 from Incheon to Yanji (Yongil), China, a flight of just more than two hours. It could be shorter when the airplane could fly North Korean sky. Our plane flew over China's sky.The Korean Writers' Association scheduled one day for the trip at the Yun Dong-ju Symposium on the poet's life and literature at Yanbian University. However, it turned down a co-sponsorship opportunity for the event owing to the tense Chinese-Korean political situation. So we stayed at a hotel in Yanji. At the symposium, I delivered the keynote speech on his life and poetry based on his Christian family background and later the influences of the German poet Rilke and French Jammes, who wrote many of religious poems dedicated to prayers. But the freedom within the university did not guarantee freedom in the nation ruled by the Communist Party. I did not know whether the Communist Party could distinguish between a political symposium and a literary symposium. I wished and hoped that the university would be free under any political regime. Even Adolf Hitler respected freedom of the University of Berlin during his Nazi regime.The following day, our group visited the house in which Yun Dong-juwas born. At the house, we held a brief memorial service under candle light and took a look at his Yonsei University graduation photo. Then, we visited his grave and held another short memorial service, bowing twice in front of his grave. Once it was in wilderness. In early 1980s, famous Korean-American physician Hyun Bong-hak raised funds to recover the gravesite and erected a tomb stone. I joined Hyun's fund-raising campaign because of my affection and admiration for both Yun and Hyun. In this pilgrimage, I was told the gravesite has been cared for by his younger sister, Hae-won. Yun was rediscovered by Korean people inside and outside Korea in the 1990s.We returned to Yongjung where he spent his middle school and where his statue stood in front of the Yongjung Museum. He was a shining star, according to the text inscribed in Chinese characters on the monument. He lived a sad, short life under the Japanese colonial rule, but he remains alive in monuments and in our hearts.Our pilgrimage group had a chance to visit the mysterious Mount Paikdu, a UNESCO's natural wonder where Dangunhad founded Korea; Chonji Lake at the top of the mountain; Domun, a city bordering China and North Korea; and finally, Ilsongjung, a hilltop overseeing the Haeran River and Youngjung City. At Ilsongjung, I asked Park Jang-sik, a singer and poet in our group, to sing the Pioneer at the. He attracted the Korean and Chinese crowd as he sang the Korean song of Yongjung. His performance was unforgettable to many people.After our homage to Yun at his hometown, we flew to Tokyo via Inchon.Japan was very technology advanced, to provide an internet service in the hotel. I was free to communicate with my friends in Korea and the U.S. from Tokyo, Kyoto and Fukuoka. At Rikkyo University, I could not find anything visible Yun Dong-ju left. I could only breathe the air of the campus and walked where Yun Dong-ju must have walked with poetry in his mind and heart. The old campus with red brick buildings reminded me of my Yonsei University Mr. Underwood designed before the 20th century. While walking and looking inside the classroom, I recited a poem of Yun that he had written easily. This poem was one of the five poems he had written during his one semester at Rikkyo. It is not easily written poem at all.¡®A poem easily written'Night rain outside the window is whispering,The 6-piece tatami room is a foreign country.The poets have sad destinies,Should I write my lines of poem?I have received money for my schoolWhich contained my parents' sweat and love.I went to the classroom to listenTo an old professor's lectureWith a notebook.I lost my childhood friends one by one.What am I doing in a foreign country?I am sinking into a deep sea alone.Life is not supposed to be easy,So it is a shame to write poem easily.6-piece tatami room is a foreign country.Night rain outside the window is whispering.I have lighted an oil lamp,And pushed out the darkness a little bit.I am the last one who is waiting for morningWhich will come as a new age.I shake my own handsWith tears and consolationFor the first time.From the poem, I still can detect his loneliness in the metropolitan city of Tokyo in 1941, when Japan was entering the Pacific War. He had written this last known poem of his on June 6, 1942, in a small boarding house room in Tokyo. This poem was like an entry from his diary. He knew the poet's destiny, but he wrote the poem like a diary entry. The poet is a prophet, longing for a new morning and new age in the night, listening to the raindrops.Our group moved to Kyoto via the Shinkansen, passing by Nagoya, where I once visited as a water resources researcher. In Kyoto, we first visited Doshisha University while it was raining and held a silent moment in front of Yun's poetry monument next to a small chapel. The university was beautiful as before. However, it was strange to see another poetry monument next to Yun's, that of Korean poet Chung Ji-yong, a prominent Doshisha University graduate who was one generation older to Yun. I did not see two poetry monuments in the same spot. I read again another one of Yun's poems, 'Prelude,' in Korean and Japanese. I gave my thanksto the university once again for designing Yun's poetry monument. I also present my translation of 'Prelude' in this. We also visited Yun's boarding house in the 1940s, whereanother monument, erected by those who love Yun,stood, inscribed with 'Prelude' in Japanese and a short biography of the poet. I could not see it in my previous trip to Kyoto. The monument touched my heart.¡®Prelude'Until last day of my life, I pray I should not be ashamed to face Heaven.The rustling sound of leaves reminds me of this fact very painfully.I must love all the dying things with the heart of praising stars.And I will walk along the path destined for me.Even tonight, the stars are touched by the wind.After Kyoto, we moved to Fukuoka, the final destination of our pilgrimage, also via the Shinkansen, passing by Hiroshima, which was once destroyed completely by an atomic bomb. All the Japanese daily newspapers reported about North Korean nuclear threats during my four days in Japan. We were quiet when we arrived at the Fukuoka detention center, where Yun was imprisoned after he was arrested at Doshisha University and where he was killed. The Japanese court sentenced him to two years in prison, which is a terrible shame! How could the court sentence a young innocent college student to two years in prison simply for writing beautiful poems in the Korean language, expressing his hope of his homeland's independence from Japanese rule.The prison is now a detention center housed in a modern building on the same spot. Nevertheless, I heard his agony in the prison cell, where he served his sentence of almost two years and the Japanese performed chemical-biological tests on him like he was a little mouse in science lab. No one in those prison conditions could celebrate his last two birthdays. All his family back in Manchuria must have prayed for his safe release on his birthdays. Now, the Korean flag flies at the Korean General Consulate Office building compound in Fukuoka. And 30 minutes' walk from the prison, on the beautiful seaside, is the SoftBank baseball stadium owned by a Korean-Japanese business tycoon Son Jung-eui.Yun is our most beloved poet in Korea, and the pilgrimage was our homage to him. Our pilgrimage was very meaningful, as we traced Yun's footsteps in Manchuria and Japan over 10 days. On the sky way to Korea, I read Yun's poem, 'Self-portrait.'¡®Self-portrait'I visit an isolated well by the rice paddy all alone.Then I look down the well quietly.There, I find: the shining moon, the drifting clouds,the unfolding sky, the blowing blue wind and an autumn.Besides, there is a man.Disliking him somehow makes me turn back.Then again on the way home, I feel sorry for him.I come back to look down and find him there once more.Disliking him once again, I head back home.I find myself missing him on the way.In the well there are the shining moon, the drifting clouds, the unfolding sky,the blowing blue wind, the advancing fall and the man himself like memories.I, with other Korean poets and writers, made a journey to sacred places of modern Korean poetry and literature in Manchuria and Japan. I paid my respects to the late Yun. Back in Seoul, I happened to visit Starfield, Intercontinental Hotel Mall, where all the books about Yun were assembled in a corner. I was happy to find such as corner dedicated to Yun in a busy Seoul shopping center in his centennial year.Dr. Choi is a poet and writer based in Virginia.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POETRY (90%); WRITERS (90%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (76%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (73%); DEATH & DYING (72%); HISTORY (72%); SEMINARIES (71%); POLLS & SURVEYS (57%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (52%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); TOKYO, JAPAN (71%)STATE: NORTHEAST CHINA (93%); JILIN, CHINA (92%)COUNTRY: CHINA (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); JAPAN (79%)LOAD-DATE: September 24, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is certain that each of us is involved at least in the guilt of criminal indifference.'- Simone Weil (1909-1943)'The death penalty, corporal punishment and public prostitution will be abolished.' - Constitution, Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (1919)Human trafficking is a unique category of evil. Deploying multifarious stratagems -- while typically preying upon the young, neediest and most disenfranchised within society -- abhorrent people-peddlers lie in wait, methodically orchestrating the enslavement of human beings. Their victims bear the image of God -- who intended for all to be free.ã€€While I remain a committed opponent of the death penalty -- the New Testament categorically prohibits it -- an atrocity, widely reported within Korea currently has shaken that conviction.ã€€The perpetrator, surnamed Lee, was apprehended for slaying a 14-year-old girl after exploiting the child for some unutterably heinous misdeed. The lecherous 35-year-old was a pimp, pornographer and sex trafficker with a penchant for child victims. Lee also inflicted extreme cruelties against his now-deceased wife, forcing her into prostitution and videotaping the rapes, which he then sold -- abusing ignominious websites that must be permanently eliminated. The trauma drove the woman to suicide.ã€€The man led a lavish lifestyle with ill-gotten donations -- amounting to $1.15 million -- through which he procured several foreign cars, according to local reports.Bereaved of her mother, Lee's 14-year-old daughter -- whose friend was the murder victim -- was doubtlessly diabolically manipulated and pressed by him to entrap his teenage victim.ã€€To cite 'intellectual disabilityï'in Lee's defense is wrong, wholly misplaced and pathetic. Lee was intelligent enough to swindle inordinate amounts of money from an unsuspecting public, to efficiently run trafficking rings enslaving human lives and shrewdly utilize social media toward these ends, all while living a life of luxury. Lee must be punished most severely. In doing so, South Korea must communicate an unambiguous anti-trafficking stance and ultimatum to traffickers across the nation (and world): Discontinue these outrages or perish.ã€€He hunted teenagers with vomit-inducing 'adsï'aimed at ensnaring '14-20 year-oldsï'into toiling at his unlawful 'massage parlorï'-- which allegedly peddled in child prostitution. There are reported to be others like him still at-large -- they need to be apprehended. ã€€President Moon, please, in the name of humanity, order no-nonsense raids of such 'massage parlorsï'in Korea, many of which reportedly are thinly masked brothels facilitating such crimes. For the love of humanity, please eradicate sex trafficking and child prostitution from this land and the Korean people -- both North and South -- forevermore.Thousands of North Korean refugees in China have also been sex trafficked and are suffering unbearable violations. Please assist and intercede for them. 'Now is the time to face up to the pain people had to endure, which was caused by the nation's failure to protect its people,ï'as was stated in your Aug. 15 address. ã€€The UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's human rights situation concluded 'a large percentage of women and girls who cross the border from the DPRK (North Korea) to China unaccompanied become victims of trafficking ... for purposes of exploitation in forced marriage and forced concubinage. A number of women and girls are also forced to work in prostitution.ï'The Commission ascertained that 'traffickers systematically target DPRK women, who are usually hungry and desperate.ï''China's refoulement practice and the DPRK's torture and punishment of repatriated persons effectively render victims without protection,ï'their 2014 investigative report determined. Some 30,000 children have been born to these trafficked refugees -- routinely involving savage rapes -- and 'because registering their birth would expose the mother's status,ï'and owing to the ever-present menace of refoulement in China, these Korean children are 'effectively rendered stateless.ï'Consequently, such innocent victims likewise are prone to sadistic people traffickers. ã€€Securing a unified homeland where repatriated refugees and their children would never be tortured, providing for these Koreans and their young ones a safe haven where they could rebuild their lives without worrying about being trafficked, raped or otherwise assaulted -- what, may I ask, could be more needful? What could be more congruous with the codes of conscience and principled vision for Korea our laudable independence activists espoused?ã€€As esteemed independence leader Ahn Chang-ho expounded, 'moral self-training equals independenceï'and the 'only means of making our nation sound is to cultivate in ourselves a sound personality.ï'Dosan underscored the necessity for 'moral educationï'-- as cleverness devoid of goodness results in destruction. ã€€In 2014, international religious leaders proclaimed -- calling for the elimination of human trafficking by 2020 -- this endemic and pernicious vortex of inhumanity signifies 'modern-day slavery.'ã€€According to multiple reports, Koreans -- of both the North and South -- somehow remain among the most trafficked groups in the world. ã€€I agree, the 'pain from forced mobilization during the Japanese colonial rule still persists,ï'as was outlined in your aforementioned speech.ã€€It is unfortunate that many today flippantly dismiss rather than reflect upon this ugly reality: Certain collaborators with fascist Japan were involved in the trafficking of women, in addition to violently persecuting Korea's independence activists -- who loved Korea more than their lives, and frequently paid the ultimate price on behalf of the nation's liberty.ã€€Indeed, exemplary freedom-fighters, on the wings of 1919's March 1st Movement -- that sublime watershed, appropriately credited as the true genesis of the Korean nation -- resolved to eradicate prostitution and its concomitant human rights violations, as evidenced by 1919's Provisional Government Constitution.ã€€To remove all damaging spiritual and psychological vestiges of Japanese colonial rule from Korean society and effectually heal associated national traumas, we must squarely punish and expunge misogynist, predacious and imbecilic malevolence toward women. Such idiocy shamefully and plainly evokes the contaminated, debased and contemptible mindsets of that rightfully denounced era, and spiritually perpetuates colonialism's abhorred legacy together with its repugnant and nefarious ill-influence.Thank you for your reported intensified efforts to stamp out sex crimes in Korea. Please effectively punish all trafficking rings and disassemble the machinery (websites, cameras, poorly enforced laws, etc.) enabling them. Please comprehensively terminate the 'modern-dayï'enslavement of all Koreans.By Robert ParkRobert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience.

The sole reason why I entered North Korea via Hoeryung city on Dec. 25, 2009 was to call attention to human rights violations that have occurred against innocents in the region and to demand better conditions -- conducive to life -- for North Koreans. On a personal level, I have been profoundly wounded and suffered loss on an incalculable and irretrievable scale as a result of these efforts to highlight the North Korean populace's severe victimization and unjust suffering. Accordingly, I sincerely beg that whatever you decide to do in concert with South Korean authorities and the international community that none of the ordinary people of both North and South Korea will ever get hurt; Koreans have already endured and sacrificed far too much.It's been brought to my attention that persons who have advised you and are within your administration profess to be Christians. Please kindly be reminded that a large number of underground Christians are within North Korea. They are the most persecuted religious group in the world, according to multiple watchdogs of religious rights internationally. As I pray your team accepts upon deep reflection, it would be decidedly un-Christian to countenance indiscriminate killings of those who are among the people in the world who suffer the most. As was recorded by a 2013 United Nations Commission of Inquiry, an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 'Christians still professing their religion secretlyï'despite 'high risksï'are in North Korea today.Another ethical dilemma vis-a-vis military strikes would be that North Korea's political prison camps -- where thousands of Christians are imprisoned and suffering grievously -- are near weapons of mass destruction facilities and test sites. For instance, as was written in the above-cited UN report: 'Political Prison Camp No. 16 covers about 560 square kilometres of rugged terrain in Myonggan, North Hamgyong Province. It is located in close proximity to the Punggye-ri nuclear test site. ... The GeoCoordinates for the central area of Camp 16 are 41.1849N 129.2032E.'Furthermore, an estimated 10 million Korean families were heartbreakingly severed by the brutal realities engendered through Korea's division. Fewer than 1 percent have been permitted to see or even hear from their missing or displaced loved ones to date. As the artificial border became fixed, whether Koreans discovered themselves in the North or the South amid the tumult and upheaval of the period was in innumerable cases but a question of chance. The South's President Moon Jae-in -- like a multitude of South Koreans, Korean-Americans and other Koreans worldwide -- has family in North Korea. Therefore, it is my sincere and tearful prayer that you, Mr. President, would take into serious consideration these excruciatingly painful and unresolved tragedies, while honoring the moral imperative to determine a peaceful resolution vis-a-vis the security predicament.We must remember Kim Jong-un disallows North Koreans all of the basic freedoms most of us take for granted. North Koreans of all classes and backgrounds are not permitted to read what they wish. Neither are they able to travel freely within their own territory. Going abroad is simply out of the question for the overwhelming majority. Punishments in retaliation for being caught with books such as the Bible, or accidentally speaking out of turn or appearing irreverent, for example, are draconian and routinely deadly. These are but a few of the reasons the whole area is often referred to as a single enormous prison.High-level escapee Thae Yong-ho, who defected to the South last year with his immediate family, characterizes North Korea as a 'gigantic slave society that exists only for the hereditary succession of the Kim family.ï'Although once among Kim Jong-un's most entrusted -- having been Pyongyang's diplomat in London for 10 years -- he bravely declared subsequent to escaping, 'I am very determined to do everything possible to pull down the regime to save not only my family members but also the whole North Korean people from slavery.'There are countless individuals -- even among North Korea's elite and military -- who confidentially share Thae's hunger and thirst for reform and transformation within the North today. I know this with certainty. Here is my earnest, wholehearted and tearful plea to you, Mr. President: Please unconditionally preserve the lives of both North and South Korea's general population. Under no circumstances -- if international laws, norms and principles professing to safeguard innocentsï'most sacred right to life contain any substance -- can the loss of their lives be tolerated. There is a thoroughly workable and peaceable solution to the North Korea crisis. It involves reaching out to the general populace of North Korea in sympathy and supporting their internal unseating of Kim Jong-un -- one individual. This procedure must be accompanied by the freeing of all political prisoners -- who are victims of crimes against humanity and possibly genocide -- which can be achieved via the mediation of those North Koreans who assume interim administrative responsibilities in the immediate aftermath of Kim's indigenous and peaceful ouster.Elite or senior-level defections are conspicuously rising. The South's Ministry of Unification recently reported that this year, North Korean elites -- including party officials, diplomats, and university professors -- are defecting twice as often as in 2016. Numerous members of the North's military have been defecting to the South as of late, as well. Countless more have died while attempting to flee.In July, an elite-level family of five -- including a former North Korean party official, his wife, son and two daughters -- struggled courageously to defect to the South. They carried poison with them to kill themselves -- as an alternative to Kim Jong-un's systematic cruelty -- if Chinese authorities forcibly repatriated them. Heartbreakingly, these refugees deserving of protection were apprehended en route. To avoid inhumanity and torture, all five members of this senior-level family committed suicide. As Thae Yong-ho has emphasized, high-ranking North Koreans are in actual fact slaves and are suffering gravely also.The overwhelming majority of North Koreans hope and yearn to be reunified with the South, to live in a gentler and more egalitarian society and to bid adieu to Kim Jong-un. Those who suggest otherwise, Mr. President, unfortunately retain an inaccurate assessment of the overall situation on the ground.Accordingly, we must reach out to the North Korean people if a peaceable solution is veritably what we seek. The native and nonviolent ousting of Kim Jong-un is distinctly achievable. I've been praying through an outpouring of tears and wholeheartedly plead for you and your administration to remember the acute suffering and unparalleled victimization of tens of millions of warm-hearted, gentle and benevolent North Koreans -- who deserve compassion and require grace -- and to please pursue a peaceable answer with regard to the security quandary. Thank you once again for your time and attentiveness to the above concerns.

"426","[Bloomberg] How to make bad situation in North Korea worse",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Bloomberg] How to make bad situation in North Korea worse   THE KOREA HERALD September 6, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 6, 2017 Wednesday[Bloomberg] How to make bad situation in North Korea worse LENGTH: 547 wordsThere are, as is often noted, no good options for dealing with North Korea. All the more reason for the US not to make the few it does have even worse.That??s what President Donald Trump is doing by linking the security threat posed by North Korea with his trade agenda. Irked by China??s failure to help the US rein in North Korea??s nuclear program, and having been stymied in his attempts to retaliate against Chinese steel dumping and intellectual property infringements, he??s vowing an implausible trade war with the US?? largest trading partner. Even less rationally, the administration has dropped hints it??s about to scrap a free trade agreement with ally South Korea.As a negotiating strategy, Trump??s approach is utterly unsuited to the North Korean crisis. For one, it??s almost certain to fail. True, China itself has had some success using its trade clout to bully smaller nations for their support of the Dalai Lama or political dissidents. But neither China nor any other nation is going to compromise what it sees as its security needs because of trade threats or concessions. South Korea is losing billions to an unofficial Chinese boycott targeting its deployment of a US-made anti-missile system -- and after the North??s latest nuclear test, President Moon Jae-in agreed to expand the system.The US also stands to lose far more than North Korea if Trump continues down this path. Despite Trump??s claims, the free trade agreement with South Korea has caused minimal, if any, damage to the US economy. By contrast, alienating a key ally, host to nearly 30,000 US troops, would erode the US deterrent against North Korea, further embolden dictator Kim Jong-un, distract from China??s lax enforcement of sanctions on the North and hurt US exporters, farmers and consumers.It??s eminently possible to simultaneously compete on trade and cooperate on security issues. Longstanding trade disputes haven??t prevented the US and China from achieving real gains on cybersecurity and climate change, for example. Nor have those deals stopped the US from pursuing its other interests both commercially and geopolitically.?It??s important to remember that having no good options doesn??t mean the US has no options short of war. The most viable path forward hasn??t changed: The US and its allies South Korea and Japan need to strengthen their deterrent capability. This will require not just additional military resources but deeper intelligence sharing, expanded missile defenses and a unified diplomatic position. And if the Treasury Department wants to cut off Chinese companies doing business with the North, it would be wise to target a high-profile firm clearly violating sanctions that China itself has approved. Efforts to spread information within North Korea and to highlight the regime??s crimes against humanity should be redoubled.At the same time, and despite China and Russia balking at stronger United Nations sanctions, the US should be quietly discussing a coordinated diplomatic approach with China, rather than issuing threats and accusations on social media. Whatever their disagreements on trade, cooperation still holds out the best chance of achieving what both sides want: a peaceful end to the current standoff.Editorial by Bloomberg(Bloomberg)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); FREE TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (89%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (89%); AGREEMENTS (89%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (77%); INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY (77%); EXPORT TRADE (77%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (76%); UNITED NATIONS (75%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (75%); TRADE DISPUTES (75%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (74%); BOYCOTTS (72%); CONSUMERS (72%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (72%); DEFENSE ELECTRONICS (71%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (71%); ARMED FORCES (71%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CRIME (70%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (70%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (69%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (69%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (66%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (64%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (90%); MOON JAE-IN (78%); KIM JONG UN (58%); DALAI LAMA (56%)COUNTRY: CHINA (98%); UNITED STATES (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); JAPAN (79%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (78%)LOAD-DATE: September 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Prior to that, Shin Kyung-sook's ""Please Look after Mom"" which was released in the United States was widely sold.Yet the two Korean novels' successes doesn't mean Korean literature is in itself well-received overseas. In fact, there's a long way to go for Korean literature to be globalized, says professor Jeong Gwa-ri of Yonsei University's Department of Korean Language and Literature.In a Translation Symposium held at Yonsei University on Wednesday, Jeong made a speech citing his own paper ""Is globalizing Korean literature possible?"" presented at the symposium. ""The sales spree of Please Look after Mom in the U.S. did not spill over to other works,"" he said, adding that ""Korean literature remains unappealing and peripheral at best to American readers.""""I had felt miserable about the situation Korean literature faced before The Vegetarian's winning of the Man Booker Prize because despite the efforts made to export Korean literature overseas, its reputation did not increase. But with The Vegetarian winning the award, I felt hopeful for the future of Korean literature. It was an opportunity to introduce the value of Korean literature overseas,"" Jeong said during a speech made at the symposium, Wednesday.""However, Korean literature is still yet to be proliferated on a global scale. Foreigners don't pay attention to Korean literature because they are shadowed by Japanese and Chinese literature. Now, readers want something universal, rather than uniquely Korean. There needs to be universality to Korean literature.""He even questioned whether 'The Vegetarian' should be considered more as a creative writing piece as Deborah Smith's translation boldly reduced, simplified or exaggerated meanings, hence creating or adding different feelings to the text.""Smith added emotional adverbs in descriptions and amplified the emotional context by making something ordinary more special,"" he said.""I'm literally lost in translation in how to interpret the definition of translation and to what extent shall we consider the role of translation in its pure form. To which extent shall we allow creativity to damage the original text?""As an alternative explanation, he introduced a new interpretation of the word ""translation"" as ""a mutually improving work process that implements the exchange between the other's linguistic aesthetics and one's own linguistic aesthetics."" In other words, if word-to-word translation is to depict the other as it is, liberal translation is to personify the other and the new interpretation, through ""mutual understanding,"" to increase understanding of the text while leaving the strangeness to it as it is.""I am not trying to make a value judgment about good and bad translation. I'm questioning the translator whether transformation of the original text is rightful and these questions must be asked,"" Jeong said.John Frankl, a professor at Underwood International College at Yonsei University, also agreed with Jeong, saying ""Translators shouldn't dilute the original text.""""If a writer is a chef, the translator is the waiter,' he said. 'All they need to do is deliver. They shouldn't try to change things in the middle. Why should they need to purposefully change things when natural transformation occurs in the process of translation?""In regards to the globalization of Korean literature, he added, ""The government or publisher shouldn't try to cater to the tastes of the exporting country's readers because it's dangerous. They should leave that to the writer. If Psy's Gangnam Style or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy were planned works, they wouldn't have succeeded.""Deborah Smith, translator of Han Kang's 'The Vegetarian,' also participated at the symposium. In response to the question ""Is a translator also a writer?"" she said, ""In the U.K., people would generally say yes, translation is an act of creative activity because a lot of translation forces creative writing.""She added, ""That doesn't mean a translator is a writer. No translation is perfect or definitive. Translation is to bring something new to literature and to language which wasn't there before. If the translator is enabling the readers to appreciate the book and many of the same things that made them fall in love with the original text, and bring out a similar reception to that of the original country, and if the author is pleased, that's the most important thing.""LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (90%); GLOBALIZATION (90%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS (90%); LITERATURE (90%); FICTION LITERATURE (90%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (87%); CREATIVE WRITING (78%); LINGUISTICS (78%); WRITERS (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (74%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (68%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); UNITED STATES (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: January 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The former brilliantly portrays the conflict between fantasy and reality represented by Blanche and Stanley. The latter movingly depicts the beautiful friendship between a street musician and a street cat he accidentally picks up and takes care of. Both the play and the film have touched the hearts of many international readers and moviegoers. Recently, I watched a Korean TV talk show discussing the problems of our society with reference to Barack Obama. Referring to Obama's success and popularity as a US president, a former Korean lawmaker said, 'Unlike Obama, we are gravely devoid of virtues of the humanities which are prerequisite to be a decent human being. We only have desires and sugarcoat them with 'gukga,ï'which means the nation and 'minjok,ï'meaning the people.I could not agree with him more because it is undeniably true that we seriously lack rigorous training in the humanities, and as a result, we often cannot contain our emotions and mundane desires. To make matters worse, we tend to gild our emotions and desires with patriotism because in Korea we can easily justify everything as long as we don the mask of nationalism. Perhaps that is why our society is plagued by unbridled emotions and unrestrained desires which can easily degenerate into sentimentalism and jealousy, and also avarice and resentment. Indeed, we tend to be easily emotional, spiteful, and jealous of those who are ahead of us and better than us. Still, however, we can conveniently justify even our personal vendetta in the name of social justice and national interest.The process of justification is usually done by a loud propaganda or a social campaign. Like a street band, we pompously propagate our personal desires so they can be justified and approved by the crowd who are enchanted by the enthralling music and thus cannot be a good judge of the situation. Watching and hearing the street band playing music loudly, people are relieved because their desires can also be justified during the parade. This can happen primarily because our education has failed. Unfortunately, we educate our students to focus only on 'How to win and surviveï'rather than pondering on 'How to live?ï'We teach our young students to become ruthless warriors, not noble knights. We teach our students how to mechanically memorize and pick the right answers in exams, instead of how to understand our country and the world. The aforementioned former National Assemblyman said, 'In other countries, even high school graduates are well grounded in the humanities. On the contrary, in Korea, even college graduates do not match their intellect and imagination.ï'Due to our undesirable tradition of scholars and writers ruling the nation during the Joseon Dynasty, many scholars of the humanities and even writers in Korea are still interested in seizing political power rather than educating students to become a decent human being. And due to the negative aspects of Neo-Confucianism, many scholars of the humanities and writers in Korea are inclined to join a faction and become involved in factional brawls. Instead, we should have taught our students to be independent of factions and political power. We should have raised them to be like tigers, independent and not afraid of being alone. We should have taught them to go against the grain. Unfortunately, however, we have turned them into domestic birds that cannot fly and stick to their flock. As a result, today we are hopelessly witnessing the outcome of our failure in liberal education. Young people in Korea do not listen to what older people have to say, dismissing their advice as old-timersï'nagging. However, if they are ignorant of history and turn a deaf ear to wise men's warning, young people will have to pay for it dearly someday. If they do not learn from history, they will surely meet a nightmarish future. Then, it will be too late to regret. We should teach our college students how to think critically about 'how to live.ï'That is why we teach philosophy and religion at the College of Humanities. At college, we should also teach students how to understand other cultures and other people. That is what the departments of foreign languages and literatures do. We should teach them how to learn from history as well. That is why we have the history department in the College of Humanities. Regrettably, our college graduates are not well grounded in liberal education yet. The outcome of such failure is disheartening. We do not seem to be interested in 'living a worthwhile life of altruismï'any more. We do not seem to understand the world or international politics well enough. And we do not seem to learn from the past at all. Instead, we have become selfish and ultra-nationalistic, and rely on a street band that plays loudly to hide and sugarcoat our desires.We should restore our long-lost spirit of the humanities to gain profound insight into life and the world.

Nowell moved to Korea in 1965 and has worked in community relations and public affairs for the USFK Yongsan command before retiring. Park, after auditioning, first performed on Yongsan for the 1959 Spring Variety Show. He and his bandmate Shin Jung-hyeon later found success in Korea's local music scene. / Courtesy of Coco CugatBy Jon DunbarHartell House, the main officer's club inside Yongsan Garrison in central Seoul, closes its doors for the last time next Wednesday. The single-story building, first constructed in 1912 for the Japanese before U.S. forces took over in 1945, is shutting down in line with the large-scale plan to relocate most of the garrison south to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, returning the land to Korea after more than a century in foreign hands.This unprecedented move will change the face of Seoul and end a complex historic era. But while many Koreans may be happy to see it go, Daniel Oh and Coco Cugat hurry to record the garrison's history before it's all gone.The husband and wife founded Yongsan Legacy, a virtual monument welcoming stories, photos and memories of the place, people and events. They are currently awaiting designation as a nonprofit organization. They work with volunteer historians tracing all manner of cultural exchanges, including food, music, fashion and art.'Through these stories and photos, Yongsan Legacy hopes to reveal the significance of the Yongsan Garrison and Yongsan area,' said Daniel Oh, an assistant professor of Korea University's architecture department.'The magnitude of Yongsan Garrison's influence on the development of modern South Korea is remarkable and deserves to be recognized; from fashion to K-pop, from friendships to families, from history to ghost stories, Yongsan Garrison offers a unique perspective in understanding Korea today.'Their current plan is to gather information, which will later form a foundation for endeavors by artists, writers, video game programmers and designers, which he hopes will inspire the architects of Yongsan's future.Currently, the city plans to create a massive urban park on the soon-to-be vacated land, demolishing more than 90 percent of the 1,000 existing structures. But Oh urges people to see beyond the physical walls and political barriers to find the base's true historic cultural value.'Almost 70 years of Seoul's rapid growth completely encapsulated the garrison making it an urban archaeological site,' Oh said. 'To many Seoulites, Yongsan Garrison is a black hole sitting in the middle of a megalopolis. Because it was an active military base, everything had to be kept secret.'For seven decades, U.S. military personnel and their families have transformed the base into a microcosm of America, with U.S.-style housing, stores, restaurants, even schools. According to Oh, between 60 and 70 percent of those who've worked on base are Korean, and Yongsan Garrison's influence trickled out into the surrounding city through countless channels.For instance, hundreds of Korean musicians in the 1960s auditioned for the American Forces Korea Network (AFKN) to perform on base, many going on to become Korea's first music superstars. Koreans started many businesses catering to U.S. personnel, selling everything from bottled water and haircuts to artistic portraits and fashion items.'For outsiders, Yongsan Garrison offers an opportunity to see the remarkable progress that Koreans have made since Japanese colonial times,' Oh said, 'and for Korean nationals, the base provides a chance to pause and reflect on their past and appreciate the present day.'Next Monday at 5 p.m., Yongsan Legacy will start its talk series at USO headquarters on Camp Kim, inviting veterans and civilians who served, worked or lived on Yongsan to share their stories.

Is it a scientific certainty about which there can be no dispute? Or is it a theory about which people with differing viewpoints can have a legitimate debate?Let??s check in and see how the Associated Press reports on the issue: ??The struggle over what American students learn about global warming is heating up as conservative lawmakers, climate change doubters and others attempt to push rejected or debunked theories into the classroom.??Wow. Not much doubt about where the AP stands. You toe the line on ??scientific consensus?? or you??re one of those awful conservative doubters trying to push rejected bunk into the classroom.Of course it??s nowhere near that simple.Schools are on firm footing with the majority of their teachings because they deal either with events that have happened or are happening (history, current events) or facts that have stood the tests of time and rigorous inquiry (mathematical formulas, geographical contours, scientific forces). These things can be imparted with certainty.At the other end of the spectrum are those things about which there are as many opinions as there are human beings, including the ??social studies?? of sociology, psychology and politics. These need to be passed along with an understanding of human frailties and uncertainties.Manmade global warming or, to use the currently favored term, ??anthropogenic climate change?? falls somewhere between those two extremes. There is a consensus that warming exists and that humankind contributes to it. But what percentage is the human contribution? What will the effects exactly be? What should be done?The answers to the questions aren??t clear, but and here??s the big problem politicians and, now, educators, think the solution is obvious: Dramatic intervention by a powerful state that mandates drastic action from everybody. That??s not science. That??s politics in the extreme.Alas, some states?? solutions are less than ideal.

"432","[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans   THE KOREA HERALD September 29, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 29, 2017 Friday[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans LENGTH: 1453 words'Koreans' own interests in their own united country had been sacrificed to power positions elsewhere -- especially to those in Japan.'- Gregory Henderson, US Foreign Service 1947-64 (1974) 'Americans and Russians both must remember that the Koreans did not ask us to divide their country, did not request that we occupy and rule them, did not solicit the governments we unleashed over their heads. Nor, unlike the Germans, had they given us the reasons for doing what we did.' - Gregory Henderson (1976)US President Donald Trump's remarks on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly -- threatening a nuclear holocaust of 25 million North Koreans if provoked -- merely conveyed in layman's terminology ('totally destroy North Korea') what has been insinuated repeatedly by Trump and prominent American figures throughout this year. Threatening genocide of tens of millions of innocents -- for Kim's agents of oppression, in sum, amount to a very small clique -- is inexcusable, cowardly and self-defeating.As The Baltimore Sun underscored in a recent editorial, 'Speaking from a prepared speech in front of leaders and diplomats from more than 100 countries, the president of the United States pledged to wipe an entire nation off the face of the Earth.'The newspaper went on to underline the perils and senselessness of threatening an 'entire nation and its 25 million people' rather than focusing on neutralizing Kim Jong-un.'President Trump has made the fight all the more difficult and dangerous by proclaiming that our aim would be not just regime change or an end to the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs but what sounds an awful lot like genocide,' voiced the newspaper. If North Korea's political prisoners and tens of millions of innocents are abandoned to be exterminated as 'collateral damageï'of indiscriminate nuclear strikes, whatsoever United Nations resolutions, a nearly-400 page UN-mandated report, whatsoever utterances by prominent personages referencing a 'responsibility to protectï'(R2P) norm, assurances of 'never again,ï'lofty rhetoric citing 'universal human rightsï'and the like -- will have amounted to hogwash. Or, if you prefer, as enunciated by Carla Del Ponte -- who resigned in protest from a UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria -- just 'alibisï'deployed expediently in lieu of obligatory, needful and life-saving measures.The Baltimore Sun stressed, 'Trump is both threatening even greater harm to the North Korean people than its own government has inflicted and is only increasing the likelihood that the Kim regime will consider it necessary to maintain its nuclear program or even launch a first strike.'UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has specified that Kim's escalating center-stage tussle with the US over his nuclear and missile projects is the world's worst crisis. Guterres, South Korea and the global community must sternly prohibit nuclear attacks -- sleazily being cited as an 'optionï'to interdict Kim's acquisition of an operational ICBM -- and unfailingly preserve the lives of both North and South Korea's inhabitants. Our common humanity is on the line. Moreover, we mustn't forget that innumerable South Koreans, virtually all North Korean refugees, many Korean-Americans and countless others throughout the worldwide Korean diaspora have been violently separated from their family members in the North -- including the President. South Korea and the global community must elevate their voices in a clarion manner and undertake efficacious measures for the protection and expedited release of some of the world's most systematically violated and heinously oppressed populations -- who are entrapped within North Korea's prison camp apparatus.In a Nov. 2016 lecture, Bruce Bennett of the RAND Corporation advocated 'floodingï'Kim's nuclear facilities with leaflets -- a corresponding procedure should take place forthwith to safeguard the lives of North Korea's political prisoners.Bennett concluded in an analysis published earlier this year that the 'safest and most realistic way to sheath North Korean nuclear weapons and safeguard the American peopleï'cardinally involved 'proposing a deal that gives the North Korean elite an alternative to its murderous and unstable leader.ï'He recommended for 'Seoul to propose favorable terms for Korean reunification ... negotiating a peaceful end to the 60-year-standoff on the peninsula.ï'The indigenous ousting of Kim Jong-un and Korea's peaceful reunification is an 'opportunity worth pursuingï'he indicated, and is far more viable a framework than popularized 'dead-endsï'such as military strikes - which would precipitate an altogether unwarranted, unlawful and unprecedented human catastrophe.The historical case for reconciliation between southerners and northerners -- whilst necessarily excluding the ruthless tyrant, who has perpetrated wanton carnage against our people in the North -- is overwhelmingly compelling.Trump's threats of indiscriminate nuclear holocaust conjures up analogous horrors which actually happened over the still-unresolved 1950-53 proxy war -- which could never itself have materialized had Korea been permitted to remain one country with freely-selected leaders. The US Air Force 'bombed and napalmed cities, towns and villages across the North. ... The bombing was long, leisurely and mercilessï'noted American author Blaine Harden in a 2015 commentary. These bombings were criticized as 'racist and unjustifiedï'around the world; the pitiless and overkill air campaign was a 'major war crimeï'Harden wrote.'Over a period of three years or so, we killed off -- what -- 20 percent of the population,ï'Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay relayed to the Office of Air Force History. Ex-Secretary of State Dean Rusk said the US bombed 'everything that moved in North Koreaï'-- including numberless frail innocents, both advanced in years and tender ones; many were simply stuck in the North owing to diverse mishaps as being too sickly, slow, uninformed or destitute to flee swiftly enough.At the 2013 UN hearings in Tokyo on North Korea's human rights emergency, a Japanese witness testified about Korean residents and their Japanese spouses who had naively traveled to North Korea -- but never were able to escape thereafter. Just as he stated: 'The greatest issue from my opinion is that between 1950 and 1953 during the Korean War, the North Korean capital was reduced to ashes and the war had killed a total of 3 to 4 million people and also caused 10 million families to split up. I think that is the true root cause and the starting point.'Unquestionably, external responsibility for the present crisis in North Korea is enormous. In Aug. 1945, communists comprised an insignificant minority presence in the North (ironically, greater influence was held by them in the South). The pre-eminent leader in the region, Cho Man-sik (killed in Oct. 1950), was a pacifist hero who helped organize March 1919's sublimely peaceful peninsula-wide demonstrations for emancipation. As Gregory Henderson aids us to remember in 'The Politics of the Vortexï'(1968):'The Independence Declaration was truly eloquent and moving, especially the Korean gesture of signing and reading it in full acceptance of coming arrest. There was dignity and pathos also in the unarmed demonstrations of thousands throughout the country. ... A peaceful movement, fully justified ... without any touch of selfishness.'Much of the leadership for the national movement, which actually consisted of millions, came from Pyongan Province in northern Korea. The north was clearly on a peaceful trajectory (that is, it wasn't a threat to anyone); the region's savage reorganization into the most militarized, repressive and human rights violating area on earth was exclusively the product of racist and undemocratic external impositions. The despotically-imposed Kim dynasty, never voluntarily elected by any Koreans, has unaccountably and undeservedly ruled over territories of which the precise limits were wholly prescribed by strangers who, distressingly, couldn't care less. Reparations and unification are accordingly in order, not yet another holocaust.

He has lived and worked in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq (two tours), South Sudan, Indonesia, Sudan (Darfur), Somalia, Denmark, Switzerland and Kenya.In South Sudan, he successfully negotiated the release of 3,551 child soldiers from the rebel army of the SPLA and led the largest-ever demobilization of child soldiers in 2001 during an ongoing conflict. Watch his TEDx video talk on the topic.A prolific writer, Chatterjee has a blog in Reuters and Huffington Post. Chatterjee has a Master's degree from the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in the U.S., and a Bachelor's degree from India's National Defence Academy.He was decorated for gallantry by the president of India during his service in the Indian Special Forces where he rose to the rank of Major.He is active on social media; his twitter handle is @sidchat1Chatterjee is married to Ban Ki-moon's youngest daughter Ban Hyun-hee and they have a son.While he visited Korea recently, we had a conversation with Chatterjee, a former Indian Army Special Forces officer, a feminist and a passionate advocate for youth empowerment within the United Nations in Kenya. Currently he is the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the UNDP Resident Representative in Kenya. Here are the excerpts of the interview we had with him at Songdo Convensia in Incheon.Siddharth Chatterjee is with Dr. Lakhvinder Singh at Songdo Convensia in Incheon.Q. Your wife and you work in the U.N. How did you meet your wife and what inspires you to work in the U.N.?I call it the unseen hand of destiny; maybe we were meant to meet. You know that I was a member of India's elite Parachute Regiment and my Regiment has a history in Korea. India actually provided a medical unit to attend the sick and wounded in the Korean War. With the communist invasion of South Korea in 1950, the U.N. sent out a call to the free world for assistance. The 60 Parachute Field Ambulance from India served in Korea for three and a half years (November 1950 to May 1954), the longest single tenure by any military unit under the U.N. flag.In 2004 my wife Ban Hyun-hee and I were deployed to Sudan and we had been UNICEF staff working in New York and Indonesia respectively. We were sent there to assist the UNICEF Sudan office in responding to the humanitarian emergency that was unfolding in Darfur. We met in Sudan in 2004 and by 2006 we were married.We are both passionate about our work in the United Nations. Both our families suffered as a consequence of war and conflict, Hyun-hee's family by the Korean War and my family by the partition of India in 1947. Both conflicts led to millions of deaths and large-scale destruction. My father as a matter of fact came to India as a refugee from Bangladesh, which was East Pakistan then.My wife and her siblings and I have grown up in humble circumstances. We benefited from the tireless hard work and dedication of respective parents to improve and advance our circumstances.We have known and seen firsthand many human tragedies and triumphs from which we have learnt important lessons. We are both deeply committed to advancing dignity, human development and humanity.As U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres recently remarked, 'We are a world in pieces, and we need a world at peace.' We hope to make our own contributions to that vision.Siddharth Chatterjee with Ban Ki-moon and Yoo Soon-taek in Seoul.Q. How would you describe your father-in-law, Ban Ki-moon?What defines Mr. Ban is his humility, his generosity, his very hard work and his kindness. He is an exceptional man, a gentleman and truly wonderful human being, who I have had the honor to meet and know, and call my father-in-law. He is the epitome of public service. He personifies the adage, 'service before self.'Mr. Ban grew during the Korean War. He saw the United Nations help his country to recover and rebuild. That experience was a big part of what led him to pursue a career in public service.As the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, his priorities had been to mobilize world leaders around a set of new global challenges, from climate change and economic upheaval to pandemics and increasing pressures involving food, energy and water. He has sought to be a bridge-builder, to give voice to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people.I am inspired by him every day.Q. You call yourself a feminist. Why this passion about gender equality and women's empowerment?I would say my passion for gender advocacy was cemented by my experiences in the Indian Army and at a personal level. My own grandmother was married at the age of 11 and had 15 children, 9 of whom survived. My early years in conflict settings also brought home the reality that women and children are worst affected during wars and natural disasters. While serving in the army as a young officer, I was horrified to find out that a soldier from my unit had raped a young girl.I remember the sheer fear and trauma that girl went through, and the helplessness of her family.It was a life-changing moment for me. While the punishment that followed was swift and uncompromising, it was at that moment I swore to fight all forms of misogyny, discrimination and violence.In many of the countries I worked in, disease outbreaks and lack of water and sanitation were the order of the day. Reproductive health services, including midwifery outreach services, antenatal care, management of prenatal complications and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS were not readily available in conflict regions. These problems had particularly harsh consequences among women and children.The years I spent in fragile environments will always remain a poignant reminder of the disparate harm that women are predisposed to whenever one form or other of humanitarian crisis arises. Some were victims of rape and torture, and others were widowed at young ages, their husbands murdered or kidnapped.Regrettably, even in peacetime, many societies still exhibit levels of patriarchy and misogyny that are simply appalling. The psychosocial status of the women who survived such atrocities are issues that continued to preoccupy me. When I joined the U.N. in 1997, I felt the need to advocate against all forms of discrimination against women and children.Q. How would you describe your own leadership style?The Army teaches you some very important lessons on leadership.The culture is, a leader leads from the front and knowing the right balance when to lead from behind.My principle is that when something goes wrong, I will take the hit for it and will stand by my staff. When things go well and are successful, I will ensure the credit is passed on to individuals and the team. As a matter of principle I have always requested a 360-degree performance review. Getting honest and reliable feedback is necessary to test one's own perceptions, recognize previously unseen strengths, and become aware of blind spots in one's self-perceptions.I did my last 360-degree review in 2015 and for purposes of transparency I posted it online. Leadership is an ongoing journey of self-actualization.Q. How can Kenya and South Korea collaborate?Kenya is a beacon of hope in a region mired in instability and a regional economic hub.I can see huge potential. Kenya and South Korea should seek a robust and multidimensional partnership which can be mutually reinforcing. Kenya can learn a lot from South Korea's growth model.I have recently written an article on this in the Huffington Post: 'Can the Kenyan Lion Kick High Enough to Become the South Korean Tiger of Africa?'In 1953 South Korea emerged from the ravages of a debilitating war, yet the total gross domestic product (GDP) in nominal terms has surged 31,000-fold since 1953.In 1950 the GDP per capita of South Korea was $876 and Kenya's was $947. In 2016, the GDP per capita of South Korea rose to $27,539 and Kenya's to $1,455.South Korea over the past four decades has demonstrated incredible economic growth and global integration to become a high-tech industrialized economy. In the 1960s, GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion-dollar club of world economies.While the majority of these Kenyans are occupied in the agricultural industry, technological advances and the rising prominence of the service industry threaten to render many of these superfluous unless urgent shifts in growth models are undertaken to create quality jobs.In fact youth employment is a very high priority for the president of Kenya, His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta. President Kenyatta has said harnessing the demographic dividend in Africa will depend on the continent's commitment to create sufficient job opportunities to absorb the rising number of new entrants in the job market and the preparedness of the young people to take up the jobs.President Kenyatta of Kenya and Siddharth Chatterjee in Nairobi, KenyaLessons from economic structural transformation abound especially from South Korea. Once an agricultural country like Kenya, South Korea spent much of the 20th century driving modern technologies and is now regarded as one of Asia's most advanced economies. Among the focus areas for the country were facilitating industrialization, high household savings rates, high literacy rates and low fertility rates.What South Korea achieved was fast economic growth underpinned by a strong industrial base that led to full employment and higher real wages. When the 1997 financial crisis threatened employment and welfare of its citizens in 1997, the country engaged in ambitious structural adjustment that introduced social protection measures for workers, the unemployed and poor people, in addition to reigniting the drivers of growth.South Korea's population is shrinking and Kenya and the rest of Africa's population is rapidly expanding. South Korea's investments and public-private partnerships with Kenya can open up immense opportunities of youth employment in Kenya and give access to large markets for South Korean companies in Kenya and the rest of Africa. Kenya in my view is a window to the rest of Africa with well-developed human capital and overall macroeconomic stability. With a median age of 18 years, Kenya can lead the way in reaping a demographic dividend, ensuring gender equality and women's empowerment and achieve its Vision 2030. Vision 2030 aims to transform Kenya into a middle-income country and providing a high quality of life for all its citizens by 2030. We have as a U.N. family in Kenya committed to walking this journey with the Kenyan government and the Kenyan people and I hope South Korea will join us too.Q.You have had a unusual career track, from a soldier to a humanitarian and development professional. How did you manage this transformation?Siddharth Chatterjee was an Indian Army Special Forces Officer.I owe my ability to adapt and embrace adversity and diversity to the foundations of my alma mater, the National Defence Academy and to the Special Forces unit I served in. My year of study and reflection at Princeton University was perhaps one of the most significant intellectual growth spurts and sharpened my understanding of public policy. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity I had at Princeton. I encourage everyone to take a year off in their careers to pause and go back to school. It gives you the freedom to pursue your intellectual interests, develop new capabilities, expose yourself to new approaches and methods and advance your career.Lakhvinder Singh (parvkaur@hanmail.net) is a visiting professor at the Institute of Far Eastern Studies and director of the peace program at Asia Institute in Seoul.

"436","[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost   THE KOREA HERALD August 23, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 23, 2017 Wednesday[Noah Smith] Higher minimum wages will give high tech a boost LENGTH: 862 wordsDavid Neumark, an economist at the University of California-Irvine, could safely be called a minimum-wage skeptic. Neumark has written a number of papers on the topic, all of which have found that minimum wages reduce employment by substantial amounts. This makes him a bit of an outlier in terms of the overall research consensus, which tends to find modest or no employment effects.But unlike many researchers, who maintain a laser-like focus on the question of whether minimum wage cuts jobs in the short term, Neumark has examined the policy from many angles. A recent paper of his, along with Grace Lordan of the London School of Economics, looks at how automation responds to minimum-wage increases.This is a timely research paper, because many people are worried about automation making human workers obsolete. It??s pretty obvious that higher minimum wages give employers an incentive to replace humans with machines. For example, fast-food servers can be partially replaced with automated kiosks. Japan already has plenty of these, and they work very well -- you order your food from a menu, get a ticket and pick it up at a counter.Lordan and Neumark focus on so-called automatable jobs. Economists don??t really know which jobs are more vulnerable to automation -- few might have predicted that hedge-fund managers, for example, could be put out of work by robots -- but they can make some guesses. Lordan and Neumark use the definitions of automatable jobs provided by star labor economists David Autor and David Dorn. These jobs are mostly of the routine variety -- fast-food workers, for example.The authors find that when states have higher minimum wages, low-skilled workers are less likely to work in automatable jobs. That implies that minimum wages really do spur business owners to replace humans with robots. They also find that when minimum wages are high, workers with automatable jobs are more likely to become unemployed. That could indicate that unemployment rises when minimum wages increase, but it could also just mean that when minimum wages are high, low-wage workers with routine jobs tend to switch jobs more often.Lordan and Neumark??s findings seem to confirm people??s fears that minimum wages will hasten the dreaded rise of the robots. That will certainly be used by minimum-wage opponents to make policy makers think twice about raising the wage floor. But this fearful reaction is probably overdone. Automation spurred by high wages could be a very good thing for the economy, in the long term.To see why, we should first think back to the Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain and the Netherlands in the 1700s. This was the greatest, most spectacular episode of automation that ever occurred -- miners, farmers, weavers and craftspeople of all types were put out of a job by steam engines, power looms and other machines. This hurt lots of people, but in the end, it resulted in the greatest explosion of human wealth and prosperity in history.Why did this happen? No one knows for sure, but one major theory is that high wages spurred the creation of industrial technology. Economic historian Robert Allen notes that labor was especially expensive in pre-industrial London and Amsterdam, with British wages especially high. Where businesspeople in China or India or Russia might hire armies of low-paid workers to make cloth or mine coal, British entrepreneurs had to find ways to make machines to do those jobs, because human hands were just too expensive.But unlike hiring a bunch of cheap workers, investing in innovation has positive spillovers -- one invention leads to another. Thus, high wages might have provided the spark that set humanity on the path to its current wealthy state. Growth economist Paul Romer, currently chief economist of the World Bank, formalized a similar idea in a 1987 paper. Romer hypothesized that low labor costs are actually bad for development, because they reduce the incentive to innovate and invent.Seen in this light, automation resulting from high minimum wages could be a long-term blessing. As long as humans find new useful things to do, installation of automated kiosks, self-checkout machines and industrial robots will be a boon to the workers?? wealth. There will be a period of adjustment, in which some low-wage workers are hurt. Neumark claims this adjustment will be large, although other researchers claim it will be small. But ultimately, as long as human labor doesn??t become superfluous, faster automation is a good thing.Therefore, the only people who should be scared of the long-term technological impact of higher minimum wages are pessimists who believe that humans are on the verge of obsolescence. But even these pessimists should realize that if obsolescence is on the way, lower minimum wages won??t slow it down by much. If we??re facing the rise of the robots, we might as well face it now.So don??t be scared that the minimum wage will replace human labor with machines.

However, AI is likely to make cheap labor irrelevant,' he said.As algorithms and robots replace truck drivers, factory workers and even doctors, cheap labor could lose its value, he said.'That might make future integration even harder. South Korea might face a crisis taking care of its own unemployed masses; it will not want to take care of millions of Northerners too.'He comes up with one positive influence for a faster integration of the two Koreas.'The profound changes caused by the rise of AI might destabilize the North Korean regime and lead to its collapse, while the South Korean hi-tech industry may generate so much prosperity in the South that it will actually find it easier to integrate the North,' he said.In the 21st century the rise of AI and biotechnology will certainly transform the world, but it does not mandate a single deterministic outcome, he said.'We can use it to create very different kinds of societies. How to use it wisely is the most important question facing humankind today,' he said. 'It is far more important than the global economic crisis, the wars in the Middle East, or the refugee crisis in Europe. The future not only of humanity, but probably of life itself, depends on how we choose to use AI and biotechnology.'Risks of rising nationalismHarari expressed concerns about growing nationalism worldwide which has been spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump is part of a larger nationalist wave that is sweeping over much of the world, he said. 'This is a very dangerous development. In the past, nationalism was dangerous because it bred war. In the 21st century, nationalism is even more dangerous, because in addition to fostering wars it is likely to prevent humankind from solving the existential problems we face.'He said all major problems facing the word are global in nature ? global warming, global inequality, and the rise of disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering.'In order to face these challenges successfully, we need global cooperation,' he said.He took an example that no nation can regulate bioengineering single-handedly as it won't help much if the U.S. forbids genetically engineering human babies if China or North Korea allows it.'Similarly, no nation can stop global warming by itself. Can Donald Trump build a wall against rising oceans? Because nationalism has no answer to global warming, it tends to simply deny the problem. But the problem is real,' he noted.'Hence I think the current wave of nationalism is a kind of escapism: people refusing to confront the unprecedented problems of the 21st century by closing their eyes and minds and by seeking a refuge in the fold of traditional local identities. I hope that people will wake up in time. For that, we probably need a new global ideology that can unite humankind.'If we want to survive and thrive, the world has little choice but to complement patriotism with substantial obligations toward a global community, the historian said.'If people nevertheless insist that the interests of their nation override all other loyalties and considerations, I would be curious to know how they plan to solve global warming and how they plan to handle the risks of nuclear war, artificial intelligence and biotechnology,' he said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); HISTORY (90%); LABOR FORCE (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); WRITERS (78%); PSYCHOLOGY (77%); INTERVIEWS (76%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (75%); BESTSELLERS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (70%); FACTORY WORKERS (70%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (67%); MIGRATION ISSUES (63%); EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS (63%); REFUGEES (50%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (78%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); ISRAEL (90%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); EUROPE (79%); UNITED STATES (78%)LOAD-DATE: February 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Once it arrives in the market, Ontruzant is expected to eat into the sales of Herceptin, which generated around $6.8 billion in global revenue for Roche in 2016.ã€€'Breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer affecting women. We hope Ontruzant will play an important role expanding patient access to trastuzumab across the region,ï'said Samsung Bioepis CEO and President Ko Han-sung in a statement.ã€€Ontruzant is the fourth biosimilar developed by Samsung Bioepis to obtain the EC's approval and the first cancer-targeting drug to score regulatory approval.ã€€The Korean drugmaker has already obtained approval for three additional biosimilar drugs in Europe, each referencing Remicade, Enbrel and Humira. They are all anti-TNF therapies targeting autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.ã€€Though Samsung is the only biosimilar challenger in the Herceptin market in Europe for now, it is closely being followed by competitors.

Also, 'We view it's too early to teach children younger than 20 about homosexuality,' according to a ministry official.This is not the first time. The same thing happened in 2015, drawing a huge backlash from civic groups.'Adolescents, who are most impressionable, need to receive comprehensive sex education including homosexuality to accept gender identity naturally,' the secretary general of the Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, said during an interview with Yonhap News Agency.The secretary general also said the group plans to launch a campaign to scrap the education ministry's sex education guidelines. The group condemned the decision for violating basic human rights.Meanwhile, parent groups welcomed the ministry's decision.One group called Next Generation said Saturday, 'It is quite natural that the education ministry decided not to provide education promoting homosexuality for the future of our sons and daughter.'The education ministry explained that even though the guidelines did not include homosexuality, teachers can answer related questions from students and have discussions on it during classes. 'The schools have already been providing education on the understanding of gay rights in social studies,' the ministry official said.The educator's move runs counter to a slowly growing awareness about homosexuality in Korea.Homosexuals are still suffering hard from discrimination as homosexuality is a strong taboo here; however, more people are coming forward seeking social acceptance, as the annual 'Queer Festival' demonstrates.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: GAYS & LESBIANS (95%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (94%); SEX EDUCATION (92%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); LGBT RIGHTS (89%); CHILDREN (78%); ADOLESCENTS (78%); GENDER & SEX DISCRIMINATION (78%); DISCRIMINATION (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (78%); INTERVIEWS (74%); GENDER IDENTITY (73%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: January 22, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"441","[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea '",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea '  Korea Times February 5, 2017 Sunday   Korea TimesFebruary 5, 2017 Sunday[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea 'LENGTH: 2113 wordsThe following is the full interview with Yuval Noah Harari, author of the international bestsellers 'Sapiens' and 'Homo Deus.' - ED.Q. How do you think that the development of algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), will affect North Korea's political system that is dominated by third-generation dictator Kim Jong-un?A. It could affect it in various and even contradictory ways. One scenario is that the North Korean regime will not be able to adapt to the new realities. Since North Korea at present has no advanced Infotech industry, as AI becomes more and more critical both for the economy and for the military, North Korea might become economically poorer and militarily weaker than ever before. Unable to provide for its own citizens or to blackmail its neighbors, the Kim regime will collapse.Another scenario is that North Korea will leap-frog ahead, becoming for example the first country in the world where all vehicles are self-driving. There are advantages to being an underdeveloped centralized dictatorship. Consider what might happen if South Korea tries to ban human drivers and switch to a completely self-driving transport system. South Korean citizens privately own millions of vehicles, and many might object to losing their freedom and their property. There will also be objections from taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and even traffic cops, who will all lose their jobs. There will be strikes and demonstrations. The initiative could also be forestalled by legal and even philosophical conundrums if a self-driving car causes an accident, whom do you sue? Or suppose a self-driving car lost its breaks due to some malfunction, and has to choose between driving forward and killing five innocent pedestrians, or swerving to the side and endangering its own passengers. What should the car do?In a free market democracy like South Korea, it will not be easy to confront all these challenges. Now consider North Korea. There are very few vehicles there, taxi drivers cannot demonstrate, truck drivers cannot strike, and all legal and philosophical difficulties can be solved in a single afternoon with the stroke of a single pen. You really need to convince just one person, and the country could switch overnight to a fully automatic transport system.A third scenario is that North Korea uses AI to become a full-fledged Orwellian dystopia. Each citizen will be required to wear a biometric device that not only monitors everything you do and say, but could even monitor your blood pressure and brain activity. In Soviet days the KGB could never really know everything about you, and could not be sure what you were thinking, because the KGB did not have the data and the computing power necessary. But using our growing understanding of the human brain, and using the immense powers of machine learning, the North Korean regime might be able for the first time in history to know what each and every citizen is thinking each and every moment. If you look at a picture of Kim Jong-un on the wall, and the biometric sensors pick up the telltale signs of anger (higher blood pressure, increased activity in the amygdala), you'll be in the gulag tomorrow morning.Q. How do you think that the fast rise of AI will affect the South-North relationship?A. In the immediate future, the greatest impact might come from cyberwarfare. The South will face a constant danger of cyber-attacks from the North, and will find it difficult to deter the North from such attacks or retaliate to them. The North's very backwardness will protect it. If the North disrupts online bank services in the South, what will the South do? It cannot disrupt online bank services in the North, because there aren't any. Will it bombard Pyongyang in retaliation?The rise of AI might also make any future integration of North and South more difficult, for both cultural and economic reasons. AI is likely to transform the culture and even psychology of South Koreans, and if North Koreans do not undergo a similar revolution, the gap between the populations would become bigger than ever before. It is beginning to happen even today. Just think of the cultural gap between a South Korean teenager glued to her smartphone, Youtube, Instagram and Twitter and a North Korean teenager who might well be dumbfounded to see people walking down the street and constantly looking at small screens in their palms.As for the economic gap, in the past the South was apprehensive of unification because of the expected economic cost. Nevertheless, there were also potential economic benefits, because the North had one important economic asset to contribute to a united Korea: a disciplined and cheap work force. However, AI is likely to make cheap labor irrelevant. As algorithms and robots replace truck drivers, factory workers and even doctors, cheap labor would lose its value. That might make future integration even harder. South Korea might face a crisis taking care of its own unemployed masses; it will not want to take care of millions of northerners too.Of course there might be positive influences as well. As noted earlier, the profound changes caused by the rise of AI might destabilize the North Korean regime and lead to its collapse, while the South Korean hi-tech industry may generate so much prosperity in the South that it will actually find it easier to integrate the North. Nobody really knows for sure.Q. In your new book the 'Homo Deus,' you talked about ""logic bombs."" Is it safe to assume that North Korea has also installed many logic bombs in South Korea?A. It is extremely likely.Q. How would you evaluate U.S. President Donald Trump's policies such as anti-trade measures (the renegotiation of NAFTA and the KORUS FTA, and the withdrawal from TPP)? How would you evaluate Trump's policies including travel bans on immigrants from Muslim countries and refugees?A. Donald Trump is part of a larger nationalist wave that is sweeping over much of the world. This is a very dangerous development. In the past, nationalism was dangerous because it bred war. In the 21st century, nationalism is even more dangerous, because in addition to fostering wars it is likely to prevent humankind from solving the existential problems we face.Today all our major problems are global in nature: global warming, global inequality, and the rise of disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering. In order to face these challenges successfully, we need global cooperation. For example, no nation can regulate bioengineering single-handedly. It won't help much if the US forbids genetically engineering human babies, as long as China or North Korea allows it. Similarly, no nation can stop global warming by itself. Can Donald Trump build a wall against rising oceans? Because nationalism has no answer to global warming, it tends to simply deny the problem. But the problem is real. Hence I think the current wave of nationalism is a kind of escapism: people refusing to confront the unprecedented problems of the twenty-first century by closing their eyes and minds and by seeking a refuge in the fold of traditional local identities. I hope that people will wake up in time. For that, we probably need a new global ideology that can unite humankind.There is still plenty of room in the world for the kind of patriotism that celebrates the uniqueness of my nation and stresses my special obligations towards it. Yet if we want to survive and flourish, humankind has little choice but to complement such local loyalties with substantial obligations towards a global community. If people nevertheless insist that the interests of their nation override all other loyalties and considerations, I would be curious to know how they plan to solve global warming and how they plan to handle the risks of nuclear war, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.Q. Do you think that Google and Baidu are not doing the right thing by collecting personal data and taking advantage of them?A. Collecting and analyzing personal data on billions of people certainly has its advantages, not just to the corporations doing it, but also to the public. It could be used, for example, to provide people with much better healthcare. If Google or Baidu monitors my biometric data and compares it with the biometric data of millions of other people, they could detect the early signs of cancer, when it is possible to nip it in the bud. They could detect the early signs of a flu epidemic, when it is relatively easy to prevent it from spreading. They could alert me that my nutrition is sub-optimal, and tailor a diet for my unique body. I believe that in the 21st century there will be a huge battle between privacy and health, and that most people will choose to sacrifice their privacy for the sake of better healthcare.At the same time, there are obvious dangers inherent in allowing corporations and governments to know so much about us and to monopolize our personal data. Given enough data and enough computing power, external algorithms could know us better than we know ourselves. And then Google, or the government, could predict our decisions, manipulate our emotions, and gain absolute control over our lives. Not just in North Korea, but also in South Korea, Big Data might create a Big Brother that knows everything and controls everything.In ancient times land was the most valuable resource, hence much of politics revolved around the question who owns the land. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution the question became who owns the means of production. In the 21st century the question will be who owns the data. At present, people are giving up their most valuable asset, their personal data, in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. People should be reminded of the famous maxim that 'if you get something for free, you are probably the product'.Q. In the era of a-mortals, whenever it would be, do you think that religions would lose its raison d'etre and disappear? Or it will continue to exist?A. First, we should understand what religion is. Religion is not belief in gods. Rather, religion is any system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in super-human laws. Religion tells us that we must obey certain laws that were not invented by humans, and that humans cannot change at will. Some religions, such as Islam, Christianity and Hinduism, believe that these super-human laws were created by the gods. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Capitalism and Nazism, believe that these super-human laws are natural laws. Thus Buddhists believe in the natural laws of karma, Nazis argued that their ideology reflected the laws of natural selection, and Capitalists believe that they follow the natural laws of economics.No matter whether they believe in divine laws or in natural laws, all religions have exactly the same function: to give legitimacy to human norms and values, and to give stability to human institutions such as states and corporations. Without some kind of religion, it is simply impossible to maintain social order. During the modern era religions that believe in divine laws went into eclipse. But religions that believe in natural laws became ever more powerful. In the future, they are likely to become more powerful yet. Silicon Valley is today a hot-house of new techno-religions. They promise all the old religious prizes ? happiness, peace, prosperity, and eternal life ? but here on earth with the help of technology, rather than after death with the help of celestial beings.Q. Is there anything else you want to comment on to Korean readers?A. I would like to emphasize that technology is never deterministic. We can use the same technological breakthroughs to create very different kinds of societies and situations. For example, in the 20th century people could use the technology of the Industrial Revolution ? trains, electricity, radio, telephone ? in order to create communist dictatorships, fascist regimes or liberal democracies. Just think about South Korea and North Korea: They have had access to exactly the same technology, but they have chosen to employ it in very different ways.In the 21st century the rise of AI and biotechnology will certainly transform the world, but it does not mandate a single deterministic outcome. We can use them to create very different kinds of societies. How to use them wisely is the most important question facing humankind today. It is far more important than the global economic crisis, the wars in the Middle East, or the refugee crisis in Europe. The future not only of humanity, but probably of life itself, depends on how we choose to use AI and biotechnology.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); DICTATORSHIPS (89%); AUTONOMOUS MOTOR VEHICLES (88%); WRITERS (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (77%); BRAIN (77%); DEMOCRACIES (72%); BIOMETRICS (72%); TRUCK DRIVERS (72%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (57%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: February 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

While 76.5 percent worry that their own jobs will be threatened, a bigger 83.4 percent projected that their children will face an even tougher job market.The center canvassed 1,041 men and women in age groups of their 20s to 50s from April 18 to 21. The results have a plus or minus 3 percentage point margin of error.Another 85.3 percent agreed that the divide between the rich and the poor will deepen with the advent of the fourth industrial revolution.The hardest hit job sectors, as cited by the respondents, include manufacturing (63.7 percent), bank staff (41.2 percent), office workers (29 percent), sales agents (25.4 percent), delivery service personnel (22.9 percent) and farmers (20.7 percent).The depth of concerns about job security differed according to the level of education received, the survey indicated. Whereas 81.1 percent of people with a high school diploma or lower felt threatened, a smaller 66.7 percent of people with graduate school credentials or higher felt the same threat.Despite such concerns, 82.6 percent of the people saw the event as beneficial to mankind.

"446","Luc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"August","Luc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual   THE KOREA HERALD August 23, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDAugust 23, 2017 WednesdayLuc Besson explains why ?Valerian? is a bit unusual LENGTH: 626 wordsIconic French director Luc Besson??s recent film ??Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets?? showcases his own brand of space adventure, but the epic sci-fi flick ultimately aims to deliver a message of diversity and humanity, the director says.??I??m sorry to be so naive and not cynical, but I think if we put money first and humans second, we are all going to go to war and die,?? said the acclaimed filmmaker, best known here for ??Leon: The Professional?? (1994), ??The Fifth Element?? (1997) and ??Taxi?? (1998), at a press conference at CGV Yongsan in Seoul, Tuesday. ???Valerian,?? available in 3-D, is set in the 28th century in a universe where species from all corners of space have come together to build Alpha, a sort of galactic capital. They live in harmony there, exchanging knowledge and culture. Dane DeHaan stars as the space federation??s police agent Valerian, while Cara Delevingne plays fellow cop and partner Larueline. The two set out on a mission to retrieve a rare treasure, and uncover the secret behind the destruction of a planet and species. ? ??I met Dane and after a few minutes, I knew he would be Valerian.??Besson said he made model-turned-actress Delevingne jump through various hoops for the role. ??She didn??t used (to act) so much before so I made her work. I tortured her, because I needed to know if she has something inside, something real. And I discovered she has a lot. She is a natural born actress.???The endeavor was something Besson had been imagining for several years. But the $180 million project, brimming with worlds created with computer graphics, creatures and vehicle rides through space was not so simple to execute. ??The technology was ready after ??Avatar,?? which made everything possible,?? he said, referring to James Cameron??s 2009 sci-fi that pioneered the use of new 3-D filming techniques. Besson??s ??Valerian?? is a remake of well-known French comics ??Valerian and Laureline?? from 1967 which influenced on future sci-fi stories, including the ??Star Wars?? series. In order to recreate and expand on the world of the comics, Besson toured the world and handpicked 12 designers.??First year, I don??t even give them the script because I don??t want them to be limited. I??d say ??28th century, let??s go, guys. Go everywhere.?? They came back with 6,000 drawings of the craziest things I??ve seen in my life -- the craziest creatures, spaceships, systems.?? ? Besson describes ??Valerian?? as a ??fun?? film with humor and relatable characters.??It??s not a huge drama where the hero lost his mother. It??s a fun film. ... By the way, the hero is a bit stupid and pretentious. So he??s like us. The real hero is the girl, as usual. Because in life, we all know that the woman is ruling the house.?? Most Hollywood sci-fi flicks these days tend to offer bleak depictions of our future world, Besson pointed out.???The aliens are coming to destroy everything and aliens get punished. I??m not saying I??m against it, I??m reacting to it.?????Valerian?? presents a world where ??all the aliens are friendly,?? he said. ??We can shake their hands. The villains are us, as usual.??An ambitious opera of fantastical creatures and settings, ??Valerian?? hopes to stoke the imagination of adults.??When we??re young we??re able to dream. When you grow up you become more pragmatic, more cynical. ... So the film is about that. The film is unusual. It??s different because I wanted to remind adults (of) the power of dreaming. Even for adults I think the film is a good medic, a pill.???Commercially, the high-budgeted film is shaping up to be a flop in North America and Europe, where it opened earlier. ??Valerian?? is set to hit local theaters on Aug. 29.

"447","[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"September","[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans   THE KOREA HERALD September 29, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 29, 2017 Friday[Robert Park] Trump threatens Holocaust of 25 million Koreans LENGTH: 1460 words'Koreans' own interests in their own united country had been sacrificed to power positions elsewhere -- especially to those in Japan.'- Gregory Henderson, US Foreign Service 1947-64 (1974) 'Americans and Russians both must remember that the Koreans did not ask us to divide their country, did not request that we occupy and rule them, did not solicit the governments we unleashed over their heads. Nor, unlike the Germans, had they given us the reasons for doing what we did.' - Gregory Henderson (1976)US President Donald Trump's remarks on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly -- threatening a nuclear holocaust of 25 million North Koreans if provoked -- merely conveyed in layman's terminology ('totally destroy North Korea') what has been insinuated repeatedly by Trump and prominent American figures throughout this year. Threatening genocide of tens of millions of innocents -- for Kim's agents of oppression, in sum, amount to a very small clique -- is inexcusable, cowardly and self-defeating.As The Baltimore Sun underscored in a recent editorial, 'Speaking from a prepared speech in front of leaders and diplomats from more than 100 countries, the president of the United States pledged to wipe an entire nation off the face of the Earth.'The newspaper went on to underline the perils and senselessness of threatening an 'entire nation and its 25 million people' rather than focusing on neutralizing Kim Jong-un.'President Trump has made the fight all the more difficult and dangerous by proclaiming that our aim would be not just regime change or an end to the country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs but what sounds an awful lot like genocide,' voiced the newspaper. If North Korea's political prisoners and tens of millions of innocents are abandoned to be exterminated as 'collateral damageï'of indiscriminate nuclear strikes, whatsoever United Nations resolutions, a nearly-400 page UN-mandated report, whatsoever utterances by prominent personages referencing a 'responsibility to protectï'(R2P) norm, assurances of 'never again,ï'lofty rhetoric citing 'universal human rightsï'and the like -- will have amounted to hogwash. Or, if you prefer, as enunciated by Carla Del Ponte -- who resigned in protest from a UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria -- just 'alibisï'deployed expediently in lieu of obligatory, needful and life-saving measures.The Baltimore Sun stressed, 'Trump is both threatening even greater harm to the North Korean people than its own government has inflicted and is only increasing the likelihood that the Kim regime will consider it necessary to maintain its nuclear program or even launch a first strike.'UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has specified that Kim's escalating center-stage tussle with the US over his nuclear and missile projects is the world's worst crisis. Guterres, South Korea and the global community must sternly prohibit nuclear attacks -- sleazily being cited as an 'optionï'to interdict Kim's acquisition of an operational ICBM -- and unfailingly preserve the lives of both North and South Korea's inhabitants. Our common humanity is on the line. Moreover, we mustn't forget that innumerable South Koreans, virtually all North Korean refugees, many Korean-Americans and countless others throughout the worldwide Korean diaspora have been violently separated from their family members in the North -- including the President. South Korea and the global community must elevate their voices in a clarion manner and undertake efficacious measures for the protection and expedited release of some of the world's most systematically violated and heinously oppressed populations -- who are entrapped within North Korea's prison camp apparatus.In a Nov. 2016 lecture, Bruce Bennett of the RAND Corporation advocated 'floodingï'Kim's nuclear facilities with leaflets -- a corresponding procedure should take place forthwith to safeguard the lives of North Korea's political prisoners.Bennett concluded in an analysis published earlier this year that the 'safest and most realistic way to sheath North Korean nuclear weapons and safeguard the American peopleï'cardinally involved 'proposing a deal that gives the North Korean elite an alternative to its murderous and unstable leader.ï'He recommended for 'Seoul to propose favorable terms for Korean reunification ... negotiating a peaceful end to the 60-year-standoff on the peninsula.ï'The indigenous ousting of Kim Jong-un and Korea's peaceful reunification is an 'opportunity worth pursuingï'he indicated, and is far more viable a framework than popularized 'dead-endsï'such as military strikes - which would precipitate an altogether unwarranted, unlawful and unprecedented human catastrophe.The historical case for reconciliation between southerners and northerners -- whilst necessarily excluding the ruthless tyrant, who has perpetrated wanton carnage against our people in the North -- is overwhelmingly compelling.Trump's threats of indiscriminate nuclear holocaust conjures up analogous horrors which actually happened over the still-unresolved 1950-53 proxy war -- which could never itself have materialized had Korea been permitted to remain one country with freely-selected leaders. The US Air Force 'bombed and napalmed cities, towns and villages across the North. ... The bombing was long, leisurely and mercilessï'noted American author Blaine Harden in a 2015 commentary. These bombings were criticized as 'racist and unjustifiedï'around the world; the pitiless and overkill air campaign was a 'major war crimeï'Harden wrote.'Over a period of three years or so, we killed off -- what -- 20 percent of the population,ï'Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay relayed to the Office of Air Force History. Ex-Secretary of State Dean Rusk said the US bombed 'everything that moved in North Koreaï'-- including numberless frail innocents, both advanced in years and tender ones; many were simply stuck in the North owing to diverse mishaps as being too sickly, slow, uninformed or destitute to flee swiftly enough.At the 2013 UN hearings in Tokyo on North Korea's human rights emergency, a Japanese witness testified about Korean residents and their Japanese spouses who had naively traveled to North Korea -- but never were able to escape thereafter. Just as he stated: 'The greatest issue from my opinion is that between 1950 and 1953 during the Korean War, the North Korean capital was reduced to ashes and the war had killed a total of 3 to 4 million people and also caused 10 million families to split up. I think that is the true root cause and the starting point.'Unquestionably, external responsibility for the present crisis in North Korea is enormous. In Aug. 1945, communists comprised an insignificant minority presence in the North (ironically, greater influence was held by them in the South). The pre-eminent leader in the region, Cho Man-sik (killed in Oct. 1950), was a pacifist hero who helped organize March 1919's sublimely peaceful peninsula-wide demonstrations for emancipation. As Gregory Henderson aids us to remember in 'The Politics of the Vortexï'(1968):'The Independence Declaration was truly eloquent and moving, especially the Korean gesture of signing and reading it in full acceptance of coming arrest. There was dignity and pathos also in the unarmed demonstrations of thousands throughout the country. ... A peaceful movement, fully justified ... without any touch of selfishness.'Much of the leadership for the national movement, which actually consisted of millions, came from Pyongan Province in northern Korea. The north was clearly on a peaceful trajectory (that is, it wasn't a threat to anyone); the region's savage reorganization into the most militarized, repressive and human rights violating area on earth was exclusively the product of racist and undemocratic external impositions. The despotically-imposed Kim dynasty, never voluntarily elected by any Koreans, has unaccountably and undeservedly ruled over territories of which the precise limits were wholly prescribed by strangers who, distressingly, couldn't care less. Reparations and unification are accordingly in order, not yet another holocaust.

"449","Sight of seven new planets -",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"March","Sight of seven new planets -  Korea Times March 3, 2017 Friday   Korea TimesMarch 3, 2017 FridaySight of seven new planets -LENGTH: 243 wordsThe discovery of seven Earth-size planets orbiting a dwarf star 40 light-years away - a mere 235 trillion miles from Earth as the crow flies - has excited the world's scientists in ways the discovery of other exoplanets hasn't.That's because the seven planetary siblings circling Trappist-1 are part of an older star system that happens to be close enough to Earth to be observed from a network of observatories on the ground and the Hubble Telescope in space.All seven planets are as close to Trappist-1 as Mercury is to our own sun, but the dwarf star has only the fraction of our sun's heat and light. Consequently, water can exist on the surface of those worlds without being scorched away. Temperatures may even be relatively mild on some worlds.Along with Hubble and the observatories, a powerful infrared telescope to be launched next year will aid scientists in determining the atmospheric composition of these new worlds. We'll soon know if water exists on these exoplanets and whether the chemical compounds that make life as we know it possible can be detected.If there is advanced or primitive life in that planetary system, there will be telltale signs of it in the atmosphere. Humanity is tantalizingly close to discovering whether life exists beyond the confines of this planet. Who knows? It may even usher in an era of humility and wonder.This editorial appeared on the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and was distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PLANETS & ASTEROIDS (91%); OBSERVATORIES & TELESCOPES (90%); ASTRONOMY & SPACE (78%)STATE: EARTH (94%); MERCURY (79%)LOAD-DATE: March 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"450","[Trudy Rubin] US student?s death should shine light on North Korea?s rights abuses",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Trudy Rubin] US student?s death should shine light on North Korea?s rights abuses    THE KOREA HERALD June 25, 2017 Sunday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 25, 2017 Sunday[Trudy Rubin] US student?s death should shine light on North Korea?s rights abuses  LENGTH: 972 wordsAnyone with human feelings is outraged by North Korea??s murder of Otto Warmbier.The term ??murder?? is justified, although we don??t know exactly how this bright, adventurous student was brutalized after his arrest on a tourist visit to North Korea. No other word describes the crime of sentencing Otto to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster, then holding him for more than a year while he lay in a coma and cutting off any diplomatic access to him.Yet note that, unlike Sen. John McCain, President Trump did not use the word murder in denouncing Warmbier??s death.That??s because the Trump team, like three previous administrations, is struggling to find a strategy to prevent Pyongyang from fully developing nuclear weapons. Trump advisers must have warned him to avoid threats that might provoke North Korea.So will there ever be justice for Otto? And will there ever be punishment for North Korea??s human rights crimes against its own people, which may rival those of the Nazis or Khmer Rouge in their horror and scope???In the dichotomy between the nuclear issue and the extraordinary human and personalized dimension of what North Korea has wrought, the human rights piece gets overlooked,?? says Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on US-Korea relations at the Council on Foreign Relations.Few Americans are aware of the massive system of concentration camps run by the North Koreans for anyone deemed the least critical of the regime and for the families of such ??traitors.?? A UN commission report, in 2014, complete with satellite photos of the camps, estimated that hundreds of thousands of political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades.??The inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape, and the denial of reproductive rights enforced through punishment, forced abortion, and infanticide,?? the commission found.??The unspeakable atrocities that are being committed against inmates of the political prison camps resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the 20th century.??Given such chilling fanaticism, the vicious treatment of Otto Warmbier does not seem so surprising. But the University of Virginia student ??was also a huge victim of geopolitical circumstances,?? says Snyder. His arrest in January 2016 came just at the time of North Korea??s fourth nuclear test and his trial not long before their fifth. That meant the Obama administration, and the international community ??were consumed with how to impose sanctions on North Korea and make North Korea hurt.??Perhaps the Obama White House should have tried harder to win Warmbier??s release as Trump implied in a tweet. But at a time when Washington was taking a tough line on sanctions, Pyongyang was unlikely to have responded to a request on a hostage without receiving concessions. And concessions were not in the cards.Which brings us again to the dilemma that US administrations, including Trump??s, have struggled with unsuccessfully since the 1990s: how to get the North Korean regime to stop threatening its own people, the region, American citizens and the world?When Trump took office, many of his supporters and many of my readers assumed he would just bomb North Korea into submission. The problem with that approach, even before Kim Jong-un tested nukes and a whole range of missiles, was that his heavy artillery could respond to a conventional strike by destroying Seoul, the South Korean capital. His artillery could also kill many of the 30,000 US soldiers based in South Korea.Today, Kim??s missiles can reach Tokyo and he has an arsenal of chemical weapons. Nor would bombing be likely to end the North Korean regime, or destroy Kim??s hidden nuclear stockpile. It would just make him move more quickly to put warheads on ICBMs that could reach the United States.In other words, a military option offers huge risks and insufficient rewards, as Trump already appears to realize. So he placed his hopes heavily on China, whose economic support is essential to Pyongyang??s survival. He hoped that Beijing would pressure Kim into better behavior.Trump??s latest tweets indicate that that hope has faded, as most China experts had predicted. China fears instability in Pyongyang, and regime collapse, more than it fears Kim??s nuclear program.So Snyder believes it??s time for Trump to downgrade his full faith in Beijing, and increase coordination with allies South Korea and Japan. He also thinks Trump should consider secondary sanctions on Chinese firms and banks that do business with Pyongyang.But if Warmbier??s death affected Trump as deeply as he claims, Snyder also hopes it will impel the White House to factor the human rights issue into a new approach.Because North Korea is so isolated, and international access to the country so limited, the regime is able to commit its human rights outrages out of sight. That isolation can be breached, and transparency imposed, says Snyder, if the international community publicizes the powerful indictment of abuses contained in the UN report.??North Korea treasures international prestige,?? Snyder notes, and shining a bright light on their humanitarian crimes may force Kim to reconsider some practices. It might also lead to better treatment or release of three captive Americans.??This one (Warmbier) case helps the human rights dimension break through,?? Snyder says, adding, ??That won??t bring satisfaction and accountability.??But if the United States finally leads the way in shining a light on North Korea??s obscene crimes against humanity this might at least give some meaning to Otto Warmbier??s death.By Trudy RubinTrudy Rubin is a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer. -- Ed.(Tribune Content Agency)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (91%); MURDER (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (90%); ARRESTS (90%); PRISONERS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS (88%); PRISONS (86%); NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS (78%); TORTURE (78%); POLITICAL DETAINEES (77%); SENTENCING (77%); CORRECTIONS (77%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (77%); FORCED LABOR (76%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (75%); US PRESIDENTS (75%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (75%); FINES & PENALTIES (73%); LARCENY & THEFT (72%); FOREIGN POLICY (70%); ABORTION (67%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (67%); MILITARY WEAPONS (54%)ORGANIZATION: COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS (54%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (79%); ADAM SILVER (69%); JOHN MCCAIN (55%); BARACK OBAMA (55%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (92%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%)LOAD-DATE: June 26, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

KoreaAndrew Martin, dean of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of MichiganIncoming U.S. President Donald Trump is unlikely to give up deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea despite growing protests from China, according to a U.S. security expert, Thursday.'It is clear that the nuclear issue in North Korea is not going to disappear. With regard to THAAD, my thinking is ultimately the Trump administration will be supportive of it moving forward,' Andrew Martin, the dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, said in an interview in Seoul.Martin, also a professor of political science and statistics, visited Seoul to attend the school's Seoul Alumni Dinner.The deployment plan currently faces strong opposition from China which claims the system could hurt its strategic and security interests. The country has made economic retaliations against South Korea - mostly in business and cultural areas - to pressure Seoul to scrap the deployment.'A lot of that turns on the relationship with China and I think that certainly we've seen since the election and I suspect we will see in months to come the U.S.-China relationship will continue to be strained,' Martin said.'So, I suspect Trump ultimately wants to continue with this defensive measure not only within the context of the strained relationship with China, but also because I think he understands its strategic importance of having the missile defense.'As Martin said, incoming U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn met with his South Korean counterpart Kim Kwan-jin in Washington, Tuesday, and the allies confirmed that the missile defense system will be deployed here as planned.Amid the intensifying retaliations from China, opposition parties insist the THAAD decision should be postponed until the next Korean government begins its term.Trump's N. Korea policyAs issues regarding the Middle East and the economy are expected to be high on the agenda under the Trump administration, there is speculation that the U.S. government may not keep North Korea's nuclear program on a short leash.Pyongyang is seeking to modernize its nuclear and missile weapons, as evidenced last year by two nuclear tests and a series of ballistic missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions, ratcheting up tensions in the region.However, Martin said Trump's North Korea policy in substance is not going to change very much.'He has hired foreign policy hawks on his administration. These are senior people who understand North Korean threats and security context of this region of the world,' he said, adding that civil servants in the government are acutely aware of North Korea issues.'So, I can't just imagine that the U.S. policy change would happen. It would also be very politically difficult for President Trump to change that aspect of our foreign policy.'Reportedly, the incoming U.S. administration considers imposing a 'secondary boycott' designed to punish Chinese firms doing business with North Korea as part of an effort to curb the reclusive state's missile and nuclear programs. The punishment is regarded as one of the last-remaining sanction tools against the North that the outgoing Obama administration has been reluctant to use out of concerns over souring relations with China.Seoul-Washington relationsSouth Korea has been suffering from a leadership vacuum since President Park Geun-hye was impeached, Dec. 9, and the Constitutional Court is deliberating on the case, which may take up to 180 days.As a result, the government is facing uncertainty of how to handle President Trump - an utter stranger to South Korea - in sharp contrast to Japan whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Trump in November.Martin said the leadership vacuum may adversely affect the relations between South Korea and the United States.'One of the places it makes quite difficult has to do with a crisis situation. If we were (facing a crisis) particularly given the transition is happening in the United States at the same time, I think it could get complicated very quickly,' he said.'It's also the case that the United States I believe is going to want to initiate discussions about trade and about the security and relations with other nations here in Asia.'He added: 'It is hard to dance when you don't have a partner.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (90%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (89%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); NATIONAL SECURITY (89%); POLITICS (89%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (79%); FOREIGN POLICY (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); INTERVIEWS (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (75%); DEFENSE ELECTRONICS (72%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (72%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (70%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (69%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (66%); CIVIL SERVICES (61%)ORGANIZATION: UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN (56%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (90%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)STATE: MICHIGAN, USA (79%)COUNTRY: CHINA (96%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (95%); UNITED STATES (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: January 12, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"452","[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"December","[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history   THE KOREA HERALD December 8, 2017 Friday   THE KOREA HERALDDecember 8, 2017 Friday[Eye] Scholar finds Korean identity in history LENGTH: 1124 wordsIn an age where three-minute book excerpts on mobile phones pass as 'reading,' Hahm Jai-bong, president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, has boldly set about writing five volumes on the subject of Korean identity.As he elucidates in the preface to 'Hanguk Saram Mandeulgi,' or 'Becoming Korean,' Hahm's translation of the book's title, the multi-volume work stemmed from a personal quest for self-identity. Having spent much of his formative years abroad, he had been nagged by the question of what his identity as a Korean meant since early on. 'It came as a shock that people of other countries did not know who Koreans were,' writes Hahm. Learning about Korean history and culture and passing on the knowledge to foreigners would be a way to confirm and strengthen his identity as a Korean, Hahm had thought as a student. 'The more professional reason was that as an academic teaching about Korea, political theory or philosophy, or Korean politics at US colleges and Europe, it always fell on me to explain Korea,ï'said Hahm during a recent interview with The Korea Herald at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.'Because of my major (he holds a doctoral degree in political science from Johns Hopkins University), I tried to delve into East Asian political philosophy in an effort to explain why Korea did this and that, the country's economic development and democratization,ï'said Hahm.'What was distinctive about Korea? I tried to answer in various ways. At some point, everything congealed. You can explain it only to a certain extent if you are using a theory. History was the missing component,ï'he said about the very broad scope of the book. The first volume, which came out in late September from the Asan Academy, is an extensive examination of the Joseon period through the 'pro-Chinese isolationist factionï'discourse that deals not only with Joseon itself, but with developments in China and Japan as well. The following volumes will discuss 'becoming Koreanï'through four additional discourses: Pro-Japanese Enlightenment faction, pro-American Christian faction, pro-Soviet Communist faction and ethno-nationalist faction. The second volume is due to be released next week and he is currently writing the third volume.Hahm's ambitious and sweeping quest has great relevance for today's Korea. 'I am trying to explain 'What is juche ideology of North Korea? Where does this incredible sense of siege mentality come from?ï'We see a lot of that in South Korea, too. A lot of anti-foreign sentiment, even though we are very open. There are remnants of nativism, racism which we know are getting stronger as we enter the age of multiculturalism,ï'he said.He finds historical similarities in 'wijeongcheoksaï'faction, or a faction that called for national isolation and exclusion of foreigners, that rose to prominence in the mid-19th century Joseon as the kingdom attempted to adjust to the reality of the fall of Ming China and the rise of Qing China. Although the tributary relations continued between the two countries, the literati of Joseon adopted the concept of 'Little Sinocentrism,ï'arguing that Joseon had succeeded Ming China as the true upholder of neo-Confucianism, the state ideology of Joseon.'Are there parallels here? How are what happened in the mid- to late-19th century affecting our way of thinking?ï'Hahm asked rhetorically.He argues that Joseon's Confucian identity led Koreans to reject their identity when Joseon fell and that this was when Koreans starting for a new identity. Will he be making any controversial claims in the upcoming volumes?'Pro-Japanese faction discourse will be the most controversial. I will be making a new argument on Korea's initial engagement with Japan,ï'he said.'The isolationists are considered the original nationalists while the pro-Japanese faction were extolled for their modernizing effort although they were unsuccessful,ï'he said. 'I start the second volume with the statement that Koreans learned the concept of independence from Japan. From international relations perspective, Japan taught Korea independence because it wanted to breakdown the sino-centric order,ï'said Hahm.In fact, the Independence Gate, erected in 1897 on the spot where a gate greeting Qing envoys once stood with fund raised through a public campaign, symbolizes Joseon's declaration of independence. The 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the first Sino-Japanese War had led to China's recognition of the 'full and complete independence and autonomy of Joseon.'Coming back to Joseon and its lessons for today, Hahm said, 'Ideology should not dominate politics,ï'noting how Joseon scholars and officials had put up a 'valiant defense of Confucianismï'which ultimately stifled Korean society. 'The worst atrocities occur when theories, ideologies, intellectuals dominate,ï'Hahm warned. Asked if his personal question on identity has been resolved through the writing of the book, Hahm said, 'Identity is always on the move. This does not deny the originality and genius of Korean people, however,ï'he said. 'My initial conclusion concerns how these five discourses are manifested in today's society. Korean history shows that when we open up, we prosper. Yet, we think the best way to preserve identity is to close off,ï'he said.'Joseon was successful because it adopted a global standard. Toward the end, Joseon chose isolation which cost it its sovereignty. After independence, North Korea chose isolation,ï'he said. 'At the end of the day, who represents Korea better? The bastardized South Korea,ï'Hahm said. 'We need to understand how cultures, identities change and evolve. The lesson is to open up.ï''Now that I am writing this book, nobody can claim to be more Korean than anyone else,ï'he said. 'I used to be defensive when people said, 'You're Americanized.''While he wrote the book primarily for himself, he also wrote it for young college students, fellow academics and foreigners, with an English-language edition in mind.'On a personal, national level, I wanted to show how difficult it was being a Korean, especially when I was growing up in the West. I can write this because Korean identity is as solid as it can be. I feel incredible pride at the incredible success of Korea. I feel relief for the young generation who do not have to struggle about it,ï'he said.By Kim Hoo-ran (khooran@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POLITICAL SCIENCE (91%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (90%); POLITICS (90%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HISTORY (77%); PHILOSOPHY (77%); RACE & ETHNICITY (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (73%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (73%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (72%); CERTIFICATES  DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (72%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (69%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (64%)ORGANIZATION: INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (84%); JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY (54%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (78%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); CHINA (79%); JAPAN (79%); EASTERN ASIA (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); EUROPE (79%); ASIA (76%)LOAD-DATE: December 8, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

A Korean-language version was published last week. / Courtesy of Gimmyoung PublishersQ: Do you think that President Trump can really attack North Korea due to the Stalinist state's nuclear threat to the U.S.?A: Trump certainly has the capability to attack North Korea. Whether he will actually do it _ I don't know. Nobody knows, not even Trump. One of the characteristics of the Trump administration so far, is that it makes very unexpected moves and abruptly reverses its own policy. Given the unpredictable and impulsive character of both the Trump administration and the Kim regime in North Korea, I am afraid that the danger of violent conflict in the Korean peninsula today is considerably higher than it was before.Q: AI seems to be the most significant factor in the future competition but Korea lags behind advanced countries in the segment. What do you think the country should do to catch up with AI leaders? If you were the owner of Samsung, the country's top conglomerate, what you would do to lead the AI competition?A: I cannot give any practical advice on how to develop an AI industry. I am not an AI expert. However, I can say that AI is likely to be the most important factor in the economic developments of the coming decades. It will change almost every industry and profession, be it transportation, healthcare, education or the military. Human drivers, doctors, teachers and soldiers will increasingly be replaced or augmented with AI.AI might even begin to replace human artists, as it learns how to detect and manipulate human emotions. We often think that the main business of artists is to reflect or inspire human emotions such as joy, sadness, love or anger. But how do I recognize your emotions? I do so by analyzing external signals such as yours words, your facial expression, and your tone of voice. Computers now learn how to analyze human speech, human facial expressions and human tone of voice, and in some cases they do it better than the average human. By looking at muscle movements and eye movements, a computer can judge whether you are sad or angry.Yet computers might soon be able to do far more. In the coming decades biometric sensors are likely to become ubiquitous, and a computer connected to such sensors could analyze not just your facial expression and your tone of voice, but also what is happening inside your body. By monitoring your blood pressure, brain activities and countless other biometric data an AI could know whether you feel anger, or sadness or love with far greater accuracy than any human psychologist or artist. Though the AI will not have any emotions of its own, it could learn how to play on human emotions as if they were a keyboard. So even singers, poets, musicians and painters might be replaced or augmented by AI.When the Industrial Revolution began in the nineteenth century, a few countries such as Britain, France and Japan mastered the new technologies of steam engines, trains and telegraphs. Most countries, such as China, Korea and India, remained far behind. The industrial nations then conquered and exploited everybody else. It took countries such as China, Korea and India almost 150 years to close the gap that opened in the nineteenth century. Now a similar thing is happening with AI and biotechnology. The potential power of AI and biotechnology is far greater than the power of steam engines and the telegraph. A small number of countries are leading the revolution in AI and biotechnology. Most countries remain behind. It is very likely that the countries who master AI and biotechnology will completely dominate the world. This time those left behind will probably never get a chance to close the gap. For the power of AI and biotechnology will make it possible to start engineering and producing bodies, brains and minds. The gap between those who know how to produce bodies, brains and minds and those who don't know how to do it, is likely to be far bigger than the gap between those who know how to produce a steamship and those who don't.*Do you think that Trump's protectionism would change the world economy?If Trump adopts a radical protectionist policy it could destabilize not just the global economy, but also the global political system. It is a very dangerous development, because the main problems we face today are all global in nature, and in order to solve them we need effective global cooperation rather than nationalist protectionism. One obvious example is climate change, which threatens the prosperity and even the survival of human civilization. To counter this threat we need global agreements. It won't be enough if only China reduces greenhouse gas emissions while the United States continues with business as usual, and it is very unlikely that any one country will agree to hamper itself with strict environmental regulations while its economic competitors refuse to do the same.Another threat we face is disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering. A single government cannot do much about the dangers inherent in AI and bioengineering, because science and technology are global rather than national projects. No nation can regulate AI single-handedly. It won't help much if the EU forbids the production of fully autonomous weapon-systems, as long as the U.S. or Russia allows it. Indeed, because of the immense potential of such disruptive technologies, if even one country takes a high-risk high-gain path, other countries will follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.Similarly, we need to create a global safety net to protect humans against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will create immense new wealth in hi-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley, while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries such as Honduras and Bangladesh. There will be more jobs to software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Honduran and Bangladeshi textile workers and truck drivers. Will American governments raise taxes on the hi-tech giants in Silicon Valley in order to support or retrain unemployed Bangladeshis? This is very improbable. We now have a global economy, but politics is still very national. Unless we find solutions on a global level to the disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the resulting chaos, violence and immigration waves will destabilize the entire world.*Would you say something to Korean readers who long for the publication of the Korean-language version of Home Deus?I think nowhere are the promises and dangers of 21st century technology clearer than in the Korean Peninsula. During the past decades Koreans have used the same technologies to create radically different societies in the North and South. The South is now a vibrant liberal democracy, while the North is a poor and ruthless dictatorship. The differences between them are so big, that they can be seen even from outer space. A famous satellite image shows the Korean Peninsula at night, with South Korea appearing as a sea of light, while North Korea is enshrouded in darkness. The meeting point of these two radically different societies is among the most explosive fault-lines in the world. The Peninsula totters on the brink of a nuclear war, reminding us of technology's power to threaten the very existence of our species.Humankind is now gaining access to even more powerful technology than nuclear energy, but we are not sure what to do with the new technology. In the coming decades we could use genetic engineering, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology to construct either paradise or hell. The benefits of making wise choices will be immeasurable, whereas the cost of unwise decisions may be the elimination of humanity itself. It is up to all of us to choose wisely.*Do you have a plan to write another book? If so, what it would be about?Not at present. I have been working very hard in the last two years on Homo Deus, and I need some time to rest.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); BIOMETRICS (85%); WRITERS (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (77%); HEALTH CARE (74%); BRAIN (72%); PATTERN RECOGNITION (72%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (70%); ECONOMIC NEWS (69%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (69%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (67%); ARMED FORCES (63%); PSYCHOLOGY (63%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: May 23, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Unable to find information on life here geared toward Latin Americans, the 25-year-old set out to fill the void. ??I came in the summer and everything was so crazy for me at the beginning. People??s outfits, how they behave, the food. It was really difficult,?? he said. After discussing the lack of resources with a friend, they decided to create content to ??bridge the gap between Asia and Latin America.?? Through the Latcor Grupo Facebook page for Latin American people in Korea, Juan wants to create a go-to source for anyone seeking to learn about Latin America here.The latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that there were just over 6,000 people from Latin America in Korea at the end of July, a 12.8 percent increase from a year prior. Brazilians account for the largest number of Latin Americans, followed by those from Mexico and Peru. With a growing population here, Latcor wants to unify Latin Americans in Korea and help them adjust to life here by providing information on scholarships, visas, jobs, language classes and entrepreneurship. They also produce videos -- available in Korean and Spanish -- about life in Korea and use the Lactor platform to make original content where people can discover Latin America. By testing the Korean public??s general knowledge of Latin America and quizzing them on everything from famous people to traditional cooking utensils, the group wants to introduce more culture that goes beyond a general association that usually begins and ends with coffee. While Juan has had a positive experience here and has mainly received questions of curiosity, he acknowledges that isn??t the case for everyone. As Korea become more multicultural, it brings with it changes to the idea of what it is to be Korean. Juan hopes the Lactor group can be used to reach out to the public for cultural exchanges and understanding. ??There are a lot of cultural differences (between Koreans and Latin Americans). People in Latin America are more open,?? Juan said. He hopes to share this openness with a country that is known for its long work hours. ??It??s about involving more Koreans to learn about Latin America,?? Juan said.Throughout September, the Mexican Embassy is holding its Mexican Month in Korea to celebrate its 207 years of independence and 55 years of diplomatic relations with Korea. The program will feature extensive activities including culture, music, food and movies. More information is available on the Mexican Embassy website.

The university hones these principles by continuously striving to make its programs meet the needs of the day. By doing so, it nurtures the students to be successful not just in their personal careers but also valuable members of the society. 'All lessons are embedded in people - you need to go out to the world and meet different people in order to effect real change,' Yu said in an interview with The Korea Times. 'That's what we teach the students - to not just talk of doing things, but to act upon them. And to do so in a way that benefits all society.' Innovation through collaborationMany programs at Kookmin University use information technology. Yu highlighted three main programs which have proven their success: community mapping, automotive engineering, and applied design. Community mapping is a prime example of the collaborative effort between the humanities and technology departments.At the center of this program is an online application its engineering students built. Through this application, over 1,000 participating students have reported problems in various communities. In Seongbuk-gu, where the school is located, students assess public facilities in terms of their accessibility for the disabled and directly report their findings through an online application. These findings are directly sent to the district office which may then easily take the necessary measures. 'Students really enjoy the program as they are able to see their messages being heard and realized. In this age of cynicism, such experience is immensely important,' Yu said. Another major area that has seen major improvement is its applied design program. This week, the school hosted a smart fashion event in which various designs were produced using technology, including its 3D printer, the largest in the country.Yu was especially enthusiastic about this, as he believes major accomplishments can be made during his term, as the collaboration between design and technology was previously unimaginable. Its automobile program has also long been one area where the university is strong. The program was established in the 1990s at the request of SsangYong Motor, a Korean automobile manufacturer that was acquired by an Indian company several years ago after its bankruptcy. But decades later, the investment has been fruitful for the university, with many of its students landing jobs at Korea's major automobile companies. 'We do what others want to do, but either are unable to do or do not want to do,' Yu said. Growing global presence The university is also gaining a presence in the global community. The number of international undergraduate students has increased to 1,482 thanks to its many programs that cater to their needs. There are 364 international students in its graduate programs, 299 foreign exchange students and 599 students in the Korean language education center. In total, there are 2,744 international students - the fourth highest number among Korean universities according to Yu. While this is a trend shared by many universities here, Kookmin has set itself apart by providing excellent support services to these students and a program that matches each international student with a Korean student, allowing them to make a smoother transition to their lives here. 'The important thing is that the students, upon graduation, come to have a pro-Korean attitude. And this is an immensely difficult task,' Yu said. To do this, the university arranges various events for the students throughout the year; during the heated row over deployment of a U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense for example, the university hosted a barbeque for Chinese students. While 80 percent of the international student population is from China, there are also sizeable groups from Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Saudi Arabia. In fact, there are 70 students from Saudi Arabia, the highest number among all universities in Korea. 'This is because we provide greater services even after students return to their countries,' Yu stressed. Attracting international students is even more critical to counter the precipitous decline in the birth rate in Korea, although this is something that needs to be addressed by government policies, Yu said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); ENGINEERING (87%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%); AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING (70%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (65%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (63%); 3D PRINTING (60%); AUTOMAKERS (60%); DISABLED ACCESS (50%); DISABLED PERSONS (50%)COMPANY: SSANGYONG MOTOR CO (58%)TICKER: 003620 (KSE) (58%)INDUSTRY: NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (58%); SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES & PASSENGER CAR BODIES (58%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)LOAD-DATE: November 23, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

He built a clinic and treated villagers himself. About 300 patients a day visited Lee, the only doctor in the town.Lee was a father, doctor, teacher, conductor and architect in the small African village. He dug a well for people suffering a water shortage and cultivated a field to grow vegetables and crops. He also established a school and taught students music.The priest, who left a 35-member brass band in the war-torn village, died in 2010, two years after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The members of the band visited Damyang Catholic Park in the southwestern part of Korea, where Lee is buried, to pay tribute to him in 2012.'Father Lee was the first one who made the band of all the priests who engaged in missionary work in South Sudan,' said Lee Hae-dong, a priest who went to the town to carry on Lee's legacy in 2015. 'Local people view him as a visionary leader who gave hope and confidence that they can do anything so long as they are given opportunities for education.'The South Sudanese education minister said in an interview in late January: 'We expect our new textbooks to let young generations know about Father Lee and what he did. I hope our students can learn his devotion and sacrifice for the poor and the weak.'Sudan went through civil war amid conflicts between Muslim Arabs in the North and Christian and indigenous Africans in the South during 1983-2005, leaving over two million people dead.

'Sexual abuse of any type anywhere is unacceptable, unlawful, disgusting and needs to be battled by everyone. Men and women have to have absolutely no tolerance for it,' he told reporters at a press conference at the Busan Cinema Center. Bigwig producer Weinstein, who was exposed last week for sexually harassing actresses over several years, has since been fired from Weinstein Company. When asked about criticism he has faced for often pushing actresses too hard in their performances, Aronofsky replied, 'I push male actors as much as I push female actors, no difference.Aronofsky directed 2010's 'Black Swan,ï'featuring Natalie Portman as a dangerously anxious ballet dancer. 'I'm interested in humans and humanity. I've always been less attracted to making movies with so-called 'Hollywoodï'endings where things end up pretty at the end, because I don't know if that's the only way to talk about reality.'Aronofsky added that gratuitous violence or forced sexuality that is 'fetishized with no consequenceï'is 'disgusting.ï'The 48-year-old American director is here for his recent film 'mother!ï'screening in BIFF's Gala Presentation category. The film is a horrific allegorical tale starring Jennifer Lawrence as a homemaker and caregiver and Javier Bardem as a poet obsessed with creation and recognition. Many motifs and the structure of storytelling were inspired from the Bible, he said.'The Bible contains some of the oldest stories ever told. I'm interested in these ancient stories and I think they have tremendous power, and you can use them to better understand our reality as humans here in the 21st century.''Mother!ï'is firstly a personal human tale of how a home is invaded and falls apart, he said.On a second level, it is an allegory of Mother Earth and humansï'misuse of its resources, the director said.So far, 'mother!ï'has received mixed reviews.'I don't really look at reviews I try to look away from them. My mentor always said bad reviews are bad and good reviews are worse,ï'Aronofsky said. The director added he is trying to incite 'either a boo or cheerï'from audiences rather than anything in between.

Suh has been listed in Marquis Who's Who, the directory of biographies of people who have proven to be of significant value to society. She was selected for the award in June.A graduate of Seoul National University, Suh studied at the University of Kansas and has taught ceramic art at the College of Art and Design of Konkuk University from 1978 until she retired and became professor emeritus in 2013.At her studio in eastern Seoul, a handful of ceramic sculptures portraying biblical figures such as Ruth, Boaz and Obed and important events in the Bible are on display.""People might immediately think of bowls and vases when they think of ceramics, but I am more interested in abstract sculptures,"" Suh said during an interview with The Korea Times, Monday. ""For me, all shapes should include meaning. So I turned to the stories of the Bible and have interpreted them in my unique sculptural style.""She uses slicing, an unusual way to create ceramic sculpture. ""Traditionally, Koreans made pottery by throwing clay on the wheel. However, I use wire cutters to shape the wedging and bake the sliced pottery.""American art critic Jim Leedy said Suh has combined her dream of creating a glorious symbolic religious statement with the innovative use of the profound literal geometric power of nature to create a potent body of abstract work.Her sculptures are in abstract form and she said some people ask whether she has seen the biblical characters and do they look like this.""Of course I haven't seen Ruth or her mother-in-law Naomi. This is my interpretation of Ruth, who went through hardships but was loyal to Naomi. I tried to contrast the tough times and her affluent life that came later,"" Suh said.Currently, she runs the Bible House of Ceramic Art at a private apartment near Konkuk University, showcasing some of her major ceramic sculptures. However, her dream is much bigger.""If I sell my artworks to private collectors, it is no longer accessible to the public. If I donate these to a museum, they could be exhibited, but would spend most of the time in storage. So I want to open a permanent exhibition hall to display my sculptures where anyone can come see the works with an oratory in a pottery studio,"" Suh said.

It is certain that each of us is involved at least in the guilt of criminal indifference.'- Simone Weil (1909-1943)'The death penalty, corporal punishment and public prostitution will be abolished.' - Constitution, Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (1919)Human trafficking is a unique category of evil. Deploying multifarious stratagems -- while typically preying upon the young, neediest and most disenfranchised within society -- abhorrent people-peddlers lie in wait, methodically orchestrating the enslavement of human beings. Their victims bear the image of God -- who intended for all to be free.ã€€While I remain a committed opponent of the death penalty -- the New Testament categorically prohibits it -- an atrocity, widely reported within Korea currently has shaken that conviction.ã€€The perpetrator, surnamed Lee, was apprehended for slaying a 14-year-old girl after exploiting the child for some unutterably heinous misdeed. The lecherous 35-year-old was a pimp, pornographer and sex trafficker with a penchant for child victims. Lee also inflicted extreme cruelties against his now-deceased wife, forcing her into prostitution and videotaping the rapes, which he then sold -- abusing ignominious websites that must be permanently eliminated. The trauma drove the woman to suicide.ã€€The man led a lavish lifestyle with ill-gotten donations -- amounting to $1.15 million -- through which he procured several foreign cars, according to local reports.Bereaved of her mother, Lee's 14-year-old daughter -- whose friend was the murder victim -- was doubtlessly diabolically manipulated and pressed by him to entrap his teenage victim.ã€€To cite 'intellectual disabilityï'in Lee's defense is wrong, wholly misplaced and pathetic. Lee was intelligent enough to swindle inordinate amounts of money from an unsuspecting public, to efficiently run trafficking rings enslaving human lives and shrewdly utilize social media toward these ends, all while living a life of luxury. Lee must be punished most severely. In doing so, South Korea must communicate an unambiguous anti-trafficking stance and ultimatum to traffickers across the nation (and world): Discontinue these outrages or perish.ã€€He hunted teenagers with vomit-inducing 'adsï'aimed at ensnaring '14-20 year-oldsï'into toiling at his unlawful 'massage parlorï'-- which allegedly peddled in child prostitution. There are reported to be others like him still at-large -- they need to be apprehended. ã€€President Moon, please, in the name of humanity, order no-nonsense raids of such 'massage parlorsï'in Korea, many of which reportedly are thinly masked brothels facilitating such crimes. For the love of humanity, please eradicate sex trafficking and child prostitution from this land and the Korean people -- both North and South -- forevermore.Thousands of North Korean refugees in China have also been sex trafficked and are suffering unbearable violations. Please assist and intercede for them. 'Now is the time to face up to the pain people had to endure, which was caused by the nation's failure to protect its people,ï'as was stated in your Aug. 15 address. ã€€The UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's human rights situation concluded 'a large percentage of women and girls who cross the border from the DPRK (North Korea) to China unaccompanied become victims of trafficking ... for purposes of exploitation in forced marriage and forced concubinage. A number of women and girls are also forced to work in prostitution.ï'The Commission ascertained that 'traffickers systematically target DPRK women, who are usually hungry and desperate.ï''China's refoulement practice and the DPRK's torture and punishment of repatriated persons effectively render victims without protection,ï'their 2014 investigative report determined. Some 30,000 children have been born to these trafficked refugees -- routinely involving savage rapes -- and 'because registering their birth would expose the mother's status,ï'and owing to the ever-present menace of refoulement in China, these Korean children are 'effectively rendered stateless.ï'Consequently, such innocent victims likewise are prone to sadistic people traffickers. ã€€Securing a unified homeland where repatriated refugees and their children would never be tortured, providing for these Koreans and their young ones a safe haven where they could rebuild their lives without worrying about being trafficked, raped or otherwise assaulted -- what, may I ask, could be more needful? What could be more congruous with the codes of conscience and principled vision for Korea our laudable independence activists espoused?ã€€As esteemed independence leader Ahn Chang-ho expounded, 'moral self-training equals independenceï'and the 'only means of making our nation sound is to cultivate in ourselves a sound personality.ï'Dosan underscored the necessity for 'moral educationï'-- as cleverness devoid of goodness results in destruction. ã€€In 2014, international religious leaders proclaimed -- calling for the elimination of human trafficking by 2020 -- this endemic and pernicious vortex of inhumanity signifies 'modern-day slavery.'ã€€According to multiple reports, Koreans -- of both the North and South -- somehow remain among the most trafficked groups in the world. ã€€I agree, the 'pain from forced mobilization during the Japanese colonial rule still persists,ï'as was outlined in your aforementioned speech.ã€€It is unfortunate that many today flippantly dismiss rather than reflect upon this ugly reality: Certain collaborators with fascist Japan were involved in the trafficking of women, in addition to violently persecuting Korea's independence activists -- who loved Korea more than their lives, and frequently paid the ultimate price on behalf of the nation's liberty.ã€€Indeed, exemplary freedom-fighters, on the wings of 1919's March 1st Movement -- that sublime watershed, appropriately credited as the true genesis of the Korean nation -- resolved to eradicate prostitution and its concomitant human rights violations, as evidenced by 1919's Provisional Government Constitution.ã€€To remove all damaging spiritual and psychological vestiges of Japanese colonial rule from Korean society and effectually heal associated national traumas, we must squarely punish and expunge misogynist, predacious and imbecilic malevolence toward women. Such idiocy shamefully and plainly evokes the contaminated, debased and contemptible mindsets of that rightfully denounced era, and spiritually perpetuates colonialism's abhorred legacy together with its repugnant and nefarious ill-influence.Thank you for your reported intensified efforts to stamp out sex crimes in Korea. Please effectively punish all trafficking rings and disassemble the machinery (websites, cameras, poorly enforced laws, etc.) enabling them. Please comprehensively terminate the 'modern-dayï'enslavement of all Koreans.By Robert ParkRobert Park is a founding member of the nonpartisan Worldwide Coalition to Stop Genocide in North Korea, minister, musician and former prisoner of conscience. -- Ed.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: SEX TRAFFICKING (90%); CHILD TRAFFICKING (90%); HUMAN TRAFFICKING (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); PROSTITUTION (89%); DEATH & DYING (77%); MURDER (77%); ENTRAPMENT (77%); CAPITAL PUNISHMENT (77%); ILLEGAL PROSTITUTION (77%); SEXUAL ASSAULT (77%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (76%); ADOLESCENTS (75%); PORNOGRAPHY (70%); SUICIDE (69%); CHILDREN (66%); SOCIAL MEDIA (64%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)LOAD-DATE: December 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Korean culture inherits neo-Confucian ideas from the Joseon Kingdom (1392-1910), when the idea was pervasive during the period and children grew up told to obey elders and never talk back or dissent strongly against them. For elders, maintaining nonchalance was thought as one of the most important virtues to pursue.When the first season of the reality TV show 'Dictionary of Useless General Knowledge' was launched in June _ gathering four 40- and 50-something intellectuals from different fields to travel the country and fan the breeze _ many doubted its success even if it was produced by popular producer Na Young-seok.Na is best-known for producing hit variety series like '2 Days & 1 Night,' 'Grandpas Over Flowers,' and 'Three Meals a Day' and their spin-offs.Poster for reality TV show the 'Dictionary of Useless General Knowledge' / Courtesy of tvN The TV show had no concrete identity but showed intellectuals freely chatting over broad ideas that seem meaningless. Every professional finds it hard to talk outside of his expertise and when the topic is unrelated to his field, particularly, the intellect's words can easily become ordinary chatter.One of the four intellects, columnist Hwang Kyo-ik also predicted the nine-episode series would not make it to the end and stop at the fifth.'I thought producer Na Young-seok and his crew would fall into a slump through this TV program,' Hwang, an esteemed food columnist, said during cable channel tvN's brand festival at Blue Square in Hannam-dong, Sunday. 'You know, we are all old men looking haggard and chatting about not-so-easy topics on the screen. I thought the series would record low viewership rating.'But, at the same time, I thought it would be fun to watch Na and his crew fail. Unexpectedly, the result came out fairly successful.'However, the very first episode of 'Dictionary of Useless General Knowledge' began easily with a 5.4 percent viewer rating and recorded an average of 7 percent at the end according to Nielson Korea.The four professionals talk about various issues from their perspective of expertise such as society, politics, arts, science and literature as they travel particular tourist sites. The intellectuals share their background knowledge of the historical sites and approach the show in terms of humanities studies.The panels share insightful talks about topics people can easily be ignorant of and fulfill useless curiosities that anybody can have on a daily basis.'The most important thing about this variety TV show is that it talks about the humanities in a comfortable atmosphere,' said culture critic Bae Kuk-nam. 'Other entertainment shows cast a TV personality or comedian to share jokes only and they intend to make audiences laugh. But the Dictionary of Useless General Knowledge distinguishes itself by fulfilling audiences' intellectual curiosity. Plus, the humanities are on trend nowadays.'The season one panel members included novelist Kim Young-ha, writer and former health minister Rhyu Si-min, Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) scientist and professor of bio and brain engineering at Jeong Jae-seung, and Hwang.They showed old people can get together and spend the whole night chatting without establishing hierarchy. Older participants volunteered to drive the car for younger members to rest and prepare dinner if they are not so busy.'In our society, age makes order of rank and this has generated conflicts between the younger and older generations. But these days, we are witnessing more middle-aged men and women trying to communicate and seek horizontal leadership. The Dictionary of Useless General Knowledge is the epitome of the trend,' Bae said.The culture critic, however, suggested improvements for the TV show.'It is good that the show has made people to easily approach issues in humanities. But the entertainment show only deals with topics superficially and it can overlook the essence of the humanities. Another problem is the show only casts middle-aged men. I think a mixed-gender group should appear on the small screen and talk about issues more deeply,' Bae said.Riding on the popularity of the first season, the cable channel premiered the second season of the series on Oct. 27. Kim and Jeong decided to leave the show for a while to concentrate on their jobs and architect Yoo Hyun-joon and scientist Chang Dong-seon join the panels.

At its highest, the rating peaked to 8.6 percent, which is comparatively high for a cable channel TV show.Panel member Rhyu Si-min says the intellects can talk on the show for another 10 years, but it will need member changes in between because a person has a limit to knowledge and information.'The more I appear in the show, the more limit I see,' Rhyu said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: REALITY TELEVISION (79%); TELEVISION RATINGS & SHARES (79%); TELEVISION PROGRAMMING (74%); CABLE TELEVISION (74%); SENIOR CITIZENS (71%); WRITERS (67%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (91%)LOAD-DATE: November 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Two-year-old children got 2.6 private sessions per week, spending an average 47.6 minutes for one session, while five-year-olds got 5.2 sessions per week, spending 50.1 minutes for one session. Parenting experts have warned that these study hours are too much for children this young, underlining that excessive private education can have an adverse effect on a child's emotional well-being and could cause depression and other problematic behavior.Korea has ranked near the bottom among 37 OECD countries in an index measuring the happiness of children and teenagers for the past five years. If a nation's youth is so unhappy, then there is something seriously wrong with the country.In Korea's case, the dysfunctional public education system is largely to be blamed for young students' unhappiness. Because of the lax education at schools and incompetent teachers who leave it to the parents and the 'hagwon' or private academies to do their jobs, students have to spend extra time and parent have to waste money on private education. This fuels excessive competition among students from a young age, which leads to extremely stressful situations for both the parents and their children.In many cases, parents were spending money on tutoring for language education, such as Korean and English, as well as math, to get their kids ready in advance for elementary school. Korea's public schools need to diversify their curriculum so that parents don't have to spend so much money on private tutoring.These days, young couples who mostly struggle with stagnant wages, huge loans and high taxes do not have much to spare for private lessons. The high education costs are one of the reasons that young married couples shun having children. If public schools did their jobs properly, parents will at least be able to save money on private education and kids will have more time to play and partake in sports and cultural activities, which are indispensable for the healthy and happy development of children.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CHILDREN (90%); PARENTS (90%); CHILD CARE (90%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (89%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (89%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); PARENTING (78%); CHILD DEVELOPMENT (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); CURRICULA (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (78%); ADOLESCENTS (77%); PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS (73%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (73%); MARRIAGE (73%); RANKINGS (69%); MENTAL HEALTH (68%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (67%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (66%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (63%)ORGANIZATION: ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION & DEVELOPMENT (55%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (96%)LOAD-DATE: January 10, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Munmyeong High School is the only school taking part. / YonhapBy Kim Bo-eunThe plan to have schools adopt a single state-authored history textbook, one of now-impeached President Park Geun-hye's key policies, has flopped.In November 2015, the government pledged to draw up a history textbook to replace the ones of private publishers used by middle and high schools.In a Cabinet meeting the same month, Park said, 'Without knowledge of the history of one's country, one will become spiritless, and if one does not correctly learn history, one will end up without a proper spirit.'The plan met with strong opposition from liberal historians, educators and opposition lawmakers, who claimed the conservative government _ by imposing a historical view in its favor _ was attempting to justify former military dictatorships and Koreans who collaborated with Japan during Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of Korea.Some said the plan, which was to introduce the state-authored history books at all secondary schools in 2017, was the Park administration's way of marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of her father, former dictator Park Chung-hee.However, the book was compiled and the education ministry unveiled a draft last November.Controversy, developmentsAs expected, the book stated Aug. 15, 1948 _ three years after Korea's liberation from Japan's occupation _ as 'the foundation of the Republic of Korea,' instead of the 'establishment of the Republic of Korea government' as stated in other books.Liberal historians state this view downplays the significance of the independence movements that took place under Japan's rule as well as the provisional government established in Shanghai in 1919.The book also gave extensive coverage to Park Chung-hee's economic achievements during his 18-year rule, downplaying his human rights violations.The list of authors disclosed by the ministry showed they were mostly conservative _ specifically new-rightists.The ministry collected public opinion on the draft and disclosed the revisions it made the following month. The revisions, however, were only on factual errors, while comments on disputed interpretations of history _ such as on the country's establishment _ were not reflected.More than half of the 17 regional education offices nationwide vowed not to cooperate with the ministry's plan.Due to growing resistance, the ministry took a step back, altering its plan to allow schools to choose between state-authored and private publishers' books starting in 2018.In the meantime, the ministry said it would seek schools that would volunteer to employ the state-authored books on a pilot basis in 2017.However, with many education offices refusing to distribute the ministry's document outlining the pilot program, as well as opposition at schools, only three schools in the traditionally conservative region of North Gyeongsang Province applied. Among them, one pulled out after protests from students, and another was disqualified as it did not follow due procedure of holding a steering committee.Munmyeong High School in Gyeongsan is the only school taking part in the pilot program using the state-authored history book. Even there, students, teachers and parents continue to object to the decision. School parents have filed an administrative suit calling for the school to withdraw from the pilot program.The poor outcome prompted the ministry to distribute the books as learning aids to schools. Last week, the ministry said it ordered 75,000 books for 143 schools.However, according to the nation's largest liberal teachers' union, only three schools ordered the books for an entire grade of students to use for classes. The rest have simply requested copies to place in libraries, the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU) said.Meanwhile, a bill banning the use of state-authored textbooks at schools is pending at the National Assembly.Future of state-authored textbookMeanwhile, following Park's impeachment last Friday, the future of her key policies appears murky, especially hotly disputed ones such as the state-authored textbook.'We concede the plan has lost force, but as of now it is an ongoing project,' a ministry official said, Monday.However, KTU spokesperson Song Jae-hyeok said, 'It is already over; the plan has completely failed. No school will use the textbook for history class.'However, Song said the ministry will have to officially recall its plan, which will have to be a priority of the next government, he said.'At the end of the day, educators should be choosing what to teach, instead of the government imposing anything. The government should not be using its authority to support the use of a certain book.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HISTORY (91%); TEXTBOOKS (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); CONSERVATISM (89%); WRITERS (89%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (78%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (78%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (76%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (76%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (76%); TALKS & MEETINGS (76%); LIBERALISM (76%); DICTATORSHIPS (72%); ANNIVERSARIES (70%); MILITARY RULE (67%); SEPARATISM & SECESSION (64%); IMPEACHMENT (56%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (50%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (92%)CITY: SHANGHAI, CHINA (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); JAPAN (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%)LOAD-DATE: March 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is based on the historical tragedy of Koreans doing forced work on Hashima Island in Japan. Some 500 to 800 people were forcibly drafted there to serve as slave laborers during the Japanese colonial era (1910-1945).Hashima Island earned the name 'Battleship Island' from the Korean people for its shape.The tragic event remains a very sensitive issue today and the controversial man-made island was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015.Ryoo had to anticipate a certain level of criticism that would follow his movie. But it was more harsh and unacceptable than he expected.Several viewers have questioned his intention of highlighting pro-Japanese Korean characters that cooperated with Japan.Much criticism followed over leading actors' remarks during interviews that they were glad the story did not adopt the dichotomous frame of bad Japanese and good Koreans.Critics also pointed out that the movie downplayed the harsh environment and heavy labor the Koreans people suffered, especially in the scene where Ryoo depicted some drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. Victims forced into labor on Hashima Island testified that they dug coal from a mine 12 hours a day _ crouched and wearing only underwear _ in a cave where the temperature was 45 degrees Celsius. The Japanese only fed them boiled soybean oil residue and nearly 100 laborers died of malnutrition.However, Ryoo rejected the backlash, saying he is willing to accept criticism but not slander.'The created characters, events and circumstances depicted in Battleship Island are not all distorted,' Ryoo said during an interview with The Korea Times at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, Seoul, Thursday. 'We received advice from the military and historians for filming the escape scene.'We prepared for nearly four years, researching information on Hashima Island and Koreans who were forcibly drafted to serve as slave labor there. There was surprisingly little information and we travelled around to meet organizations related to Battleship Island and dug into historical material found in Japan. Audiences only take information from the movie and when the stereotype kicks in, it creates a clash.'Ryoo said it is too early to judge his film, as the historical tragedy just surfaced through popular variety TV show 'Infinite Challenge' in 2015.'We just learned about what happened in Hashima Island in the 21st century and it is very difficult to find information on it,' Ryoo said. 'It is too early to say what I've produced in the scenes is either right or wrong.'The filmmaker had to create a pro-Japanese character in the film to make it fully fledged. It was the Korean 'traitors' that angered Ryoo more.'In the scene, the Japanese don't shout at the Koreans,' he said. 'They had been taught that Koreans were inferior and recognized us as livestock. You can see it from how they piled up the dead bodies of Koreans killed during bombing raids and burned them together while chatting lightly .'Basically, this is the method of how imperialists rule their colony. They make local traitors and blame all their wrongdoings on them, and deny it was their fault. I wanted to show how it worked through the film, how the Japanese controlled the Koreans who sided with the power to suppress the nation.'Ryoo does not regret making a film about the controversial event.'Until now, I made movies that I wanted to make,' he said. 'I did not feel obliged to report on the tragedy or had an intention to make another successful commercial film with a controversial issue. I don't know how to make movies that win many praises. I just do what I think is right.'I believe there are more than 5 million 'Battleship Island' movies, as each of the 5 million people who have watched the film until now understand it differently.'The film director learned about Battleship Island when he turned 40 through a picture of Hashima Island. He said he felt embarrassed that he was ignorant of the history. There are too many controversies revolving around Korea's modern historical events and barely any of them are set as truth, he said.'We need to know what are facts and what are not,' Ryoo said. 'Diverse perspectives and interpretations can start from the fact and we need to study history in order to debate it.'On the screen monopoly issue, the filmmaker said he agrees, but has no control over film distribution. The issue has been raised for over 10 years and Ryoo said if it hasn't been fixed and everyone agrees it is a problem, legal action must change the system to prevent the monopoly.'The Battleship Island' was screened in over 2,000 theaters among 2,700 across the nation. It became the film screened in most cinemas in Korea as its distributer CJ Entertainment owns the country's largest movie theater chain, CGV.'If you know me well, I'd never agree on the screen monopoly system,' Ryoo said. 'I feel regretful and sorry. But I did not commit a crime and I don't know why I have to be at the center of the issue. I hope we can fix this problem here so it doesn't happen again in the future.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: FILM (90%); VISUAL ARTISTS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); HISTORY (89%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (78%); HISTORIC SITES (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (76%); FORCED LABOR (74%); SLAVERY (74%); DRAMA FILMS (73%); LIBEL & SLANDER (72%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (71%); MALNUTRITION (70%); SMOKING (63%); MOVIE FILMING (58%); ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES (50%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (89%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); JAPAN (93%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%)LOAD-DATE: August 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

They are from the fields of nuclear power, environmental studies, sociology and law.They regarded the committee's insufficient attempts to discuss the matter with concerned people as the main drawback.'The committee should allow both pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear experts to agree on the ground rules, but it has yet to do so,' said Eun Jae-ho, senior research fellow at the Korean Institute of Public Administration.'If it arbitrarily sets the rules, its decisions will not be accepted by those opposing the conclusion.'Yum Hyung-cheol, secretary general of the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements, expressed his concerns about the committee, criticizing it for not examining whether its polls will be accepted by the people interested in this issue.Lee Kang-won, of the Korea Center for Social Conflict Resolution, demanded the committee focus more on the opinions of experts and the people concerned.'In addition to various topics for discussion, the committee should think about how it will reflect the opinions of Ulsan residents and how it will draw public attention during the discussion,' he said.Some experts said the three-month period is too short to conduct the poll.'Germans have discussed the same matter for 20 years,' said Prof. Lee Myoung-jin of Korea University's Institute of Social Research. 'People will unlikely form a social consensus in three months. It is no different than a sudden telephone survey.'The sociologist said the committee's coming survey is nonsense, just as the nation's previous public opinion polls were that decided candidates for lawmakers and presidents.Shin Ji-hyung, a lawyer at the Green Korea Legal Center, said the committee seemed to be in confusion from the beginning, because it is struggling to finish its work within three months.Chang Moon-hee, senior research adviser at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, doubts ordinary citizens can pick up basic knowledge about nuclear power, claiming experts in science, the humanities and law should discuss the matter for a longer time and advise the government afterwards.The researcher also said the committee has been based on an 'unlevel playing field' from the beginning.'The committee seems to take its course as the President wants,' Chang said. 'The pressure will make the group of people lean to one side.'Professor Whang Joo-ho, from Kyung Hee University's Department of Nuclear Engineering, criticized the administration's attempts to ban government institutions from promoting nuclear energy. He emphasized the committee should be run fairly.Professor Yun Sun-jin, from Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental Studies, however, said the committee excluded experts on polls as it was obsessed with neutrality.'Most experts in public polls are anti-nuclear activists, so they were excluded from the committee,' Yun said.Ulsan residents chant for construction to resume on reactors 5 and 6 at the Shin Kori Nuclear Power Plant in the port city on Tuesday. Conflicts between proponents and opponents of the reactors are deepening ahead of the government's decision on them. / YonhapLegally flawlessDespite the problems, most experts agree the committee has a firm legal basis, unlike the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) labor union's claim.The union filed a lawsuit this week to nullify the committee's establishment.'The public opinion committee established without any legal basis has no right to determine the fate of nuclear power plants and the future of Korea's energy issue,' the union said in a statement.'The future of energy should be decided through discussion at the National Assembly, the representative body of the people.'Legal experts dismissed the claim, regardless of how they stand on nuclear power.'If the committee forces the government to follow its decision, its establishment should be regulated by law,' Shin said. 'Given that it defined itself as an advisory body, however, the committee can be set up on the prime minister's order.'Shin regarded President Moon Jae-in's initial plan to follow the committee's decision as the main reason for continuous provocation for legal disputes.'Moon seemingly made the remark to emphasize his desire to follow the people's opinion,' she said.Kim Tae-hoon, permanent representative of the Lawyers for Human Rights and Unification of Korea, also denied the union's claim, although he has opposed the shutdown of the reactors.However, the lawyer criticized the administration for avoiding a more efficient process. 'The basic plan for electricity supply and demand is based on the assumption that nuclear reactors will be suspended,' he said.Chang, on the other hand, agreed with the KHNP union.'The construction of power plants should be regulated by the Nuclear Power Safety Act,' he said. 'However, the government came up with the ambiguous Energy Law. A judge I know said the committee is highly likely to face legal disputes.'All of the interviewees unanimously agreed that the final decision on the reactors should be made by the government, not citizen ""jurors.""They were generally positive about the committee's attempt to limit its role to advice.'Those who major in polls think forming a consensus is better than just asking about the pros and cons,' said Kim Hak-lin, a professor at the Dankook Center for Dispute Resolution. 'I praise the committee's current stance, because its advice will help the President make a decision without a heavy burden.'Yun said, 'Although the government and the National Assembly may make the final decision, the opinions of citizens are very important.'LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); JUDGES (89%); SOCIOLOGY (89%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (88%); SUPREME COURTS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (78%); ECOLOGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (77%); ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT (76%); NUCLEAR SCIENCE (76%); ENERGY RESEARCH (76%); LAWYERS (75%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (75%); JURY TRIALS (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (72%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (72%); POWER PLANTS (71%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (71%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (67%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)ORGANIZATION: INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (54%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%)LOAD-DATE: August 9, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

By Kwon Mee-yooHuh Dong-hwa, director of the Museum of Korean Embroidery, believes Korean 'bojagi' (traditional wrapping cloth) will someday be recognized as abstract art, just like Korean modern art pioneer Kim Whan-ki's paintings.It is no coincidence that the 91-year-old collector and artist Huh is holding a solo exhibition at the Whanki Museum, which is dedicated to the late artist Kim.Titled ""Huh Dong-hwa: Abundance,"" the retrospective captures the unique esthetic sense of Huh, inspired by his extensive collection of antiques and nature.Huh is better known as an avid collector, who specializes in Korean traditional costumes, embroidery and other fabric items. He runs the Museum of Korean Embroidery in southern Seoul, which displays a thematic selection from Huh's collection, which reaches up to 3,000 items, on rotation.The collection also bridged Huh and the Whanki Museum, when the museum held an exhibition of Korean beauty in relation to Kim Whank-ki's art, featuring fabrics from Huh's collection and wooden furniture from the National Folk Museum of Korea.Holding an exhibit of Huh's work is part of the Whanki Museum's new effort, embracing artists from diverse backgrounds.""We started researching Huh's artworks, aside from his collection, as Huh is an artist who discovers creative sides from everyday life and suggests a new artistic perspective,"" said Sung Min-a, a curator of the Whanki Museum.Huh is not a typical artist who was trained professionally at an art school. Instead, he developed his own aesthetic values as he collected Korean antiques, especially colorful bojagi.""Huh is an artist out of the systemized context of the art world. However, his works represent nature, tradition and daily life. It reflects his values, bringing art closer to our lives,"" Sung said. ""Huh's works might seem unrefined at first, but they are based on auteurism.""Huh Dong-hwa's ""Fruition""Huh Dong-hwa's ""Forest""Some 500 pieces - including painting, collage, assemblage, metalworks and brooches - are on display at the three-story museum and these are only about half of Huh's oeuvre.The first floor is an introduction to the exhibit as well as Huh's artistic world, featuring his major paintings and collage works. A 2008 work 'Fruition' has a bunch of brooches pasted onto a painting of a tree, symbolizing Huh's love of nature and beauty.The half moon-shaped gallery is like a salon and visitors to the museum can enjoy Huh's fabric collage on a traditional door frame while sitting on a chair.A tall room located next to the stairs showcases a collection of handmade brooches and silk collage works displayed in the shape of a stained-glass window, as a nod to the prayer room-like atmosphere of the exhibition space.Huh Dong-hwa's fabric collage on traditional wooden door gratingsPaintings and collages on the second floor represents Huh's use of colors. The paintings have unique textures as the artist sometimes squeezes paint out of tube onto the canvas, creating clumps of paints. Huh uses bold colors and geometric shapes to portray imagery of nature as well as his life.Fabric collage works have profound colors coming from natural dyeing, which cannot be achieved by paints. Ranging from vivid red and blue to delicate yellow and green, Huh matched the scraps of fabrics in free yet rhythmic arrangement.""The sense of color expressed in Huh's works could be related to typical color field abstract or abstract expressionism, but it is rather unique, coming from the discernment trained by traditional colors,"" the curator said.Huh's signature brooches made from recycled jewels and objects are displayed on a canvas. 'Each brooch has independent charm, but we wanted to present the brooches in a way showing the flow of his perspective. So instead of displaying each in a showcase, we placed them on a canvas to relate better to all of them,' Sung said.Huh Dong-hwa's assemblage ""Family,"" left, and ""Big Family""The Whanki Museum's third-floor gallery has a large window with a view of Inwang Mountain. Huh's assemblage featuring old farming tools goes well with the nature of the area.""He is a collector as well as an artist. His works have been created over a long time and reflect the flow of time,"" Sung said.Inspired by the shapes of the agricultural equipment, Huh tells the story of Korean traditions in an engaging way. Rusty spoons become a family in a frame and bells become peonies on an old tree.Huh's fabric collage on traditional wooden door gratings speak an abstract, geometric visual language using line and color in a geometric way.In spite of his great age, Huh is still an active artist. His latest interest is creating large-scale metal sculptures. ""Metal is a material I haven't worked with before,"" Huh said. ""I always try new things and that is what I have been doing throughout my life.""The exhibit runs through May 7. Admission is 5,000 won.

Many experts believe the process of learning English is too stressful and less effective for young children.' said Kwon Ji-young, a director of early childhood education, at the MOE. 'Secondly, English will be provided in classes starting in the 3rd grade, so English classes before this only become early preparation for elementary school.'A daycare enforcement regulation under the Ministry of Health and Welfare allows foreign language classes to be taught at daycare centers. However, the government is now aiming to make changes.'An enforcement regulation at the ministry allows foreign language classes after school; we need to get rid of it,' said Kwon Byung-ki, a director of the division of childcare policy at the ministry.'Since it's not law, all we need is the minister's approval to take out the enforcement regulation.'The ministries are both onboard to ban English classes at daycare centers and a final decision is expected to be made within the month.There are around 40,000 daycare centers in Korea and 70 percent are members of the Korea Edu-care Association (KEA), which are strongly opposed to the ban.'Banning the classes overall without the consent of parents or their views is absurd. We are against the move.' said Ryu Ho-young, a manager at (KEA) 'We are scheduled to open a board of directors meeting Jan. 11 to come up with countermeasures.'Many parents are worried that the ban will leave them no choice, but to put their children through private education.'Even with the government ban on English classes, there is a good chance parents might consider sending their kids through private education, because most parents believe English is an important factor for them.' said Choi Sun-hee a teacher at a daycare center in Seoul.Many experts are worried the ban could cause a balloon effect toward private education as more parents might choose this as an alternate option.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIMARY SCHOOLS (92%); CHILDREN (90%); AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS (90%); EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); CHILD CARE (90%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (90%); PARENTS (89%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (89%); PARENTING (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (78%); LANGUAGE & LANGUAGES (78%); FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (71%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (69%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)LOAD-DATE: January 8, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

That was North American television series. I didn't have to think hard about it,' said Joe Broido, executive vice president of Canadian media production company Thunderbird Entertainment, who attended the Broadcast Worldwide 2017 (BCWW 2017), a broadcasting and media content festival, during the interview with The Korea Times, in Seoul, Wednesday. 'I've been looking at a lot of Korean dramas at the same time and this was one that will translate.'His company made a remake of 2014 Korean drama 'God's Gift,' titled 'Somewhere Between,' and has been broadcasting it both in U.S. and Canada on ABC since July, with ten episodes.The drama, telling the story of a mother whose daughter gets kidnapped and murdered time-travels to the past to save her daughter, received a lot of media attention, because it was directly programmed without being tested airing a pilot episode, which is very unusual for a U.S. TV show.He said 'Somewhere Between,' starring Paula Patton, an actress who appeared in 'Mission Impossible' and 'Deja vu,' has been very well receive in the United States and Canada.'Our audiences are enthusiastic in their response. We have loyal audience. About the same number of people show up every week, no matter where we are in the schedule or what's been before us or how it's preformed,' he said. 'They are real fans who can't wait to see the next episode and see what happens, because thanks to Choi's wonderful original God's Gift, there's been always surprise coming and it is exciting for the audiences.'Broido who came to the local annual media festival for the first time says what he sees in many television conventions is platforms breaking down obstacles between countries. 'It's fun watching formats move around the world, because it does break down obstacles between cultures and bridges between cultures. When a country buys a format, I think other people in that country who liked the format go and look at the original. A lot of reviews of our show mention God's Gift, it can be screened in the U.S.,' he said.However, 'Somewhere Between' is not his only Korean project. He partnered with Korean Canadian playwright Ins Choi, who wrote comedy 'Kim's Convenience' telling the episodes of two generations of immigrants living in the same house, which was adapted it into a Canadian sitcom on CBC in 2016. It became the broadcaster's highest rated show was decided to be renewed for a second season.'By being an ordinary family _ people who are not Korean North American _ seeing a Korean North American family makes us realize that all the families are the same. I think one of the great things about family comedies is that they show the humanity in all of us. North America has increasing numbers of cross-cultural comedies,' he said.Broido says program speak for themselves. 'Any given program from any given country will speak to people in other countries. Each culture and country has entertainment expressions that are important to themselves will or won't translate to other cultures,' he said.

"472","[Paul W. Kahn] The president?s dangerous endgame",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"July","[Paul W. Kahn] The president?s dangerous endgame   THE KOREA HERALD July 26, 2017 Wednesday   THE KOREA HERALDJuly 26, 2017 Wednesday[Paul W. Kahn] The president?s dangerous endgame LENGTH: 728 wordsPresident Donald Trump is besieged. He is reportedly looking for ways to close down the Russia investigation by the Justice Department. He already tried at least once, when he fired FBI Director James Comey. He still has the power to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller.President Nixon fired a special prosecutor, Archibald Cox. It did not go well for him, but he did it anyway. To fire Mueller, Trump probably first would have to fire Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. And to do that, he would have to finish what he??s already loudly hinting at: ridding himself of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Nixon, too, had to eliminate his attorney general and his deputy attorney general before he could get rid of Cox. No doubt, Trump will push them out with all the glee that he used to show on ??The Apprentice.??Next, the president will want to avoid the pressure that Nixon experienced to hire yet another special prosecutor. Trump reportedly is investigating pardons for all of those involved in his campaign??s interactions with the Russians. A presidential pardon need not wait for indictment, let alone conviction. Trump will announce that, with the pardons, he is putting all these ??endless, groundless attacks?? behind him, clearing the way so he can address the problems the voters elected him to solve. The agenda was ??to make America great again,?? not to waste time and energy defending against baseless charges brought by Democrats who cannot accept the results of the election.With these two moves, the president will have substantially undermined the federal government??s power of criminal accountability. What Trump cannot do, however, is shut down the congressional investigations. He controls the Justice Department, not the House or the Senate. In our system, when law ends, politics begins. The president is ultimately accountable to our elected representatives in Congress.To avoid impeachment, Trump will have to invoke yet more powers of the presidency. Here, the nation??s future looks dark. Trump can divert attention from impeachment to a national security crisis. As president, he has extraordinary power to deploy the military. He already has attacked Syria with no authorization from Congress. In this respect, too, we have a pretty good idea of what he might do: attack North Korea. It would have to involve more than the limited strikes against weapons facilities we saw in Syria, which didn??t divert much attention for very long.Is it really possible that Trump would put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Koreans in jeopardy for the sake of his own position? Would he risk a nuclear confrontation with China for personal reasons? To ask the question is to answer it. A man with no sympathetic imagination, a man whose narcissism knows no bounds, will be guided by only one thing: what is good for the Trump family. Of course, Hillary Clinton was right that such a person should never have control of the nuclear codes. Only willful blindness could keep even his supporters from acknowledging this now. We have no evidence whatsoever of the president exercising self-control. No evidence that he can separate the personal from the political. No evidence that he cares about innocent people abroad.Is this endgame unavoidable? Surely no one should believe that one or another of his advisors could convince Trump to behave himself. He will always fire the messenger. And it only gets more unlikely that he will simply let the investigation play itself out; far too many secrets may be revealed. Every day, we hear more about Russians, loans, meetings and attempted cover-ups.By all accounts, Trump is raging within the White House. He will act.Congressional leadership should be considering all of this long and hard right now. If Trump is to be stopped, legislators need to tell him in no uncertain terms that any move in the direction of this endgame will trigger impeachment. They need to proceed rapidly with their own investigations to make clear that firing Mueller and pardoning members of his family will not stop the truth from coming out. If he cannot face the truth, then Nixon??s end should be his as well. He needs to go before the missiles start flying.---By Paul W. Kahn Paul W.

"473","Harnessing politics of disruption",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","Harnessing politics of disruption  Korea Times February 8, 2017 Wednesday   Korea TimesFebruary 8, 2017 WednesdayHarnessing politics of disruptionBYLINE: By Mark LeonardLENGTH: 1046 wordsLONDON - The United Kingdom's vote to exit the European Union and Donald Trump's election as US president exposed a deep generational divide. Cosmopolitan millennials and nationalist pensioners ? what Thomas Friedman calls 'Web People' and 'Wall People' ? seem to have nothing in common. But both point to the same crisis of political representation.In the UK, for every 'Leave' voter under the age of 24, there were three over the age of 65. In the US, Trump won 53% of the over-65 vote, but was supported by only 37% of 18-29-year-olds.In both cases, the elderly were attracted by pessimistic rhetoric assailing the damage to their communities brought about by free trade, free movement, free love, and human-free technology disrupting their jobs and economic security. Young people were far more optimistic about the future, their personal prospects, and technology's potential ? and far more empathetic toward marginalized groups.The pessimists won, and now they're feeling pretty hopeful. The former optimists now fear the worst.But, despite their fundamentally different attitudes toward technology and globalization, the Web People and the Wall People have one thing in common: both are deeply skeptical of existing institutions. They think that representative democracy has broken down, and they see the creative potential of disruption.The Wall People want to smash the existing system, in the hope that something better emerges ? something that looks a bit more like the familiar world of times past (or at least of their fancy). The Web People, for their part, believe that technology must transform politics and institutions, just as it has transformed newspapers, taxi services, and hotels.The web mentality is exemplified by Vyacheslav Polonski, a 27-year-old network scientist of Ukrainian origin, who has spent time at Harvard and is currently completing a PhD in social media at Oxford University. 'We are dealing with a twenty-first-century world,' he tells me, 'but our political system has not evolved since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.'Polonski points out that our government institutions were established not just before Facebook and Instagram, but even before television and radio. Whereas our economy is now characterized by choice, customization, and participation, our politics remains stifled by bureaucracy, special interests, and entrenched-yet-declining political parties. 'As our government becomes more agile,' he says, 'people can vote for specific ideas and agendas, rather than a political party.' As a result, 'politics will become more like Uber: more decentralized, more open, more immediate.'To reinforce his point, Polonski connects me with his friend Maria Luisa Martinez Dibarboure, a 27-year-old trainee lawyer who is one of the founders of El Partido Digital, a new digital political party in her native Uruguay. 'We live in a crisis of representation,' Dibarboure tells me on Skype (how else?). 'Once people are in power,' she laments, 'they vote according to their own preferences,' not those of the voters who put them there.Dibarboure's solution is to use the Internet to ensure accurate representation. El Partido Digital is currently working to elect a representative to parliament. That representative would use the Internet to poll her constituents before each parliamentary vote, thereby ensuring that she really is a voice for voters.More intriguing, constituents will be able to delegate their votes to others, perhaps friends with more expertise on particular issues. Fred the economist could vote on my behalf on economic questions, and Anne the scientist could vote for me on environmental matters.Dibarboure's concept relies on neither elections nor referenda. Instead of representative or direct democracy, it offers what she and Polonski call 'liquid democracy' ? a system that combines the best of both. 'We are about representation, not ideology,' she clarifies. 'We don't represent left or right."" This is about the people.'Polonski and Dibarboure are members of a community of 6,000 'global shapers,' brought together by the World Economic Forum. These 23-27-year-olds are creative, connected, cosmopolitan, and full of energy. They are crestfallen about recent election results ('2016 was the year in which I lost faith in humanity,' says Dibarboure). But my sense is that they will bounce back soon, and find opportunities in today's political disruptions.This is not to say that these disruptions are the answer to their problems, or even to the problems of the Wall People. On the contrary, today's political disruptions could make some of the outcomes that these groups favor more difficult to achieve.The old and young alike hope to recapture the opportunities enjoyed by the post-1945 Baby Boom generation. But those opportunities were enabled by a commitment to collective action, broad support for redistribution, and strong economic growth ? none of which can be counted on today. On the contrary, the backlash against globalization and immigration will likely damage global growth, while the need to build ad hoc coalitions of the willing undermines progress in building new institutions. For many nowadays, redistribution has become a dirty word.So the politics supported by the Wall People isn't the answer. But nor is the politics of the Web People. While disruptive, Internet-enabled politics can upend the status quo ? the Arab Spring revolutions taught us that ? it has not proved particularly effective at creating sustainable alternatives.The grievances of the old and the young are very real. The economic gains of the last few decades have not been shared widely enough. Political parties are more beholden to themselves than they are to the communities they serve. There is socialism for the rich, and capitalism for the poor. The war on terror is creating more terrorists. And trade and migration systems are losing support.Rather than defend the status quo from the counter-revolution, the political class should work to create a new system ? one that responds to the needs of the people. Both the young and the old have made their demands known. It is time to respond.Mark Leonard is Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

This year, we are talking about the importance of putting people at the center of design no matter what new technology is introduced,' said Herald Corp. CEO Kwon Chung-won in the opening address.This year's forum was held at The Shilla Seoul and drew over 700 audience members. Leading designers from all over the world were invited to share insights on how intelligent design using the latest technology could facilitate the sustainable coexistence of man and nature.'The event will provide a platform for sharing knowledge and experience about sustainable design -- for humanity and for the Earth,' wrote Herald Corp. Chairman Jungwook Hong in his welcome message.The star-studded list of speakers included: Jaime Hayon, industrial designer and head of Hayon Studio; Claudio Francesco Bellini, CEO and founder of Claudio Bellini Design+Design; Naoto Fukasawa, product designer and head of Naoto Fukasawa Design; Carme Pigem, architect and co-founder of RCR Arquitectes; Seok Yong-bae, shoe design director and CEO of Seok; Aernout Dijkstra-Hellinga, design director of Bugaboo International; George Popescu, CEO and co-founder of Lampix; Sung Jung-gi, product designer and creative director of Daylight; and Gen Terao, founder and CEO of Balmuda Inc.'I heard that there were some major figures from the design world here today,ï'said Dijkstra-Hellinga before the forum began. 'I am looking forward to sharing insights about how we have pushed design forward at Bugaboo.'Jaime Hayon began the first session with a talk titled 'Designer's imagination that makes people dream of a better world,ï'in which he shared the ways in which he found inspiration for design from everyday life.'My way of looking at design was always observing things. Things like folklore, traveling around and getting glimpses of things have brought me inspiration to design things,ï'he said.Hayon's talk began the 'Design for Humanityï'session, which was followed by the 'Design Thinkingï'and 'The Design 4.0: New Normal Design Economyï'sessions. Each of the three sessions was punctuated with a Design Talk, in which the three speakers who had given presentations took time to discuss their ideas with the audience members.A collaborative session called HERALD X DIGIT ran concurrently with the forum, where students interested in architecture were invited to meet pivotal figures in the field to discuss how design could help achieve balance between people and the environment.Students who attended the session posed questions to Carmen Pigem, such as those about the most important aspect and most often-used materials when taking on new projects. Speakers including Fukasawa, Hayon, Bellini and Pigem also took part in Open Lounge sessions to share more stories about their work. The sessions, which were open to all participants of the Herald Design Forum, were broadcast in real time through Facebook Live.The sessions were designed to give participants and journalists at the forum a chance to interact with the speakers in a more intimate setting. At the Open Lounge sessions, students took advantage of the opportunity to ask for career advice from major gurus in their fields of interest. The Premium Talk session concluded the one-day forum, giving panelists a platform to discuss the Design Wave and how design is instigating changes in our everyday lives. Bellini and Baek Hee-sung, CEO of KEAB Architecture Design, spoke about the power of design to change the future, while George Popescu and Sung Jung-gi shared their insights on the potential use of design to bring about change. The Herald Design Forum was launched in 2011 by Herald Corp., creating an arena where the top names in design from all over the world come together to share their ideas on how design changes the world.

A total of 188 lawmakers participated in the vote, with two abstaining and two votes declared invalid.Lee, a former South Jeolla Province governor, will serve as the first prime minister of the liberal Moon Jae-in government. His premiership took effect upon receipt of an appointment letter from Moon, which took place about 80 minutes after the parliamentary approval.It came as the LKP remained against the appointment of Lee, insisting he was unqualified for the post due to 'ethical lapses.''We don't understand the ruling party pushing for his confirmation when there are many allegations left unanswered and our request to provide references was disregarded,' LKP floor leader Chung Woo-taik told reporters.Despite the main opposition party's stance, the National Assembly's special confirmation hearing committee headed by a ruling party lawmaker adopted a confirmation report on the May 24 and 25 hearings on Lee.The committee's LKP members walked out of the meeting in protest, and requested National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun to postpone tabling the confirmation motion, but to no avail. After an hour-long delay, the plenary session was held as planned.'The root of the problem is the President himself,' LKP floor leader Chung said during a press conference earlier in the day, confirming the party's decision to oppose the vote.'Moon should have tapped an appropriate figure who could have easily gained approval from the National Assembly if he had wanted to launch the new administration swiftly. It is not right to force us to agree with the nomination of someone mired in suspicions.'Lee has been dogged by the opposition parties over his wife's registration of a fake address as this was one of the five corrupt practices which President Moon had pledged not to ignore in appointing ranking officials ? military service evasion, real estate speculation, tax evasion, false residence registration and academic plagiarism.Lee's wife, then an art teacher for a public secondary school, allegedly registered a false residence in an attempt to be assigned to a school of her choice in 1989.Opposition parties have also raised questions over whether Lee abused his power in 2013 when Jeonnam Development Corp, a public organization based in the region he was later elected to govern, bought paintings by his wife at an exhibition.In the face of the opposition backlash, Moon offered an apology last week over the alleged irregularities of the nominee and asked for understanding of issues caused by the hasty nomination, which he said was inevitable as his presidency had no transition period.Following the President's apology, the minor opposition People's Party changed its position to back Lee's confirmation. The minor opposition Bareun Party said, though he was still viewed as unqualified, it would participate in the vote and left the decision in the hands of its lawmakers.Political commentators said they may have felt it burdensome to be portrayed as dragging down the new administration that enjoys high popularity with support of over 80 percent.'Lee has his faults but we consider they are not serious enough to decline him the prime minister position,' said Rep. Kim Kwang-soo, a People's Party's representative on the hearing committee.The Moon administration is expected to face a rough road ahead in seeking cooperation from the main opposition party to draw up a supplementary budget and fill in the remaining ministerial posts.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PRIME MINISTERS (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); POLITICS (89%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); APPROVALS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); TAX FRAUD (76%); ETHICS (73%); CORRUPTION (73%); PLAGIARISM (73%); SCHOOL CHEATING (72%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (72%); TAX LAW (71%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (71%); PAINTING (64%); REAL ESTATE (64%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (60%); PRESS CONFERENCES (52%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (79%)LOAD-DATE: May 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

THE KOREA HERALD May 25, 2017 Thursday   THE KOREA HERALDMay 25, 2017 ThursdayTech meets art in McGregor?s ?Atomos? LENGTH: 513 wordsHow can modern-day technology be integrated into art? According to decorated choreographer Wayne McGregor, the mix of science and art can be quite ??poetic.????We??re interested in technology, not necessarily on stage, but a way it??s inspiring process,?? said McGregor while explaining the production of his show ??Atomos,?? which is set to be performed at LG Arts Center in southern Seoul on Friday and Saturday. During the press conference on Thursday, McGregor said he and other artists at Company Wayne McGregor have drawn from wide spectrum of sources -- from cognitive neuro-science to anthropology -- as inspiration for movement.??We often work with AI, machine learning or new technological ways of working in studio, to inspire the body -- in some way -- to ??misbehave.?? We??re interested in the body doing things out of the normal way of working,?? he said, adding that he looks to ??subvert?? normal way of dancing to create a ??different kind of physical language.?? McGregor said that his curiosity toward atomizing the human body had triggered the show??s production, first performed at Sadler??s Wells Theatre in London in 2013. According to the choreographer, the show was inspired by 1982 neo-noir science fiction film ??Blade Runner,?? which explores the ethics involving technological development. The production staff had divided the movie into 1,200 pieces and reinterpreted them to form various movements, with which McGregor and his dancers expanded upon. While not re-enacting elements of the cult classic, McGregor??s work borrows themes and motions from the movie.An essential part of the production was an artificial creature, which he said was like the show??s ??11th artificial dancer.????It (artificial dancer) hijacks the moments from ??Blade Runner?? and it tries to recreate the motion that was in that tiny little ??atom?? of movement. And soon as it gets close to the motion of the atom, it evaporates and does something else,?? he said. McGregor added that he did not feel that it was necessary for the dancer to be actually shown on stage, ??Hardware just inspires different ways of generating content, makes us think differently about how we can integrate the technology,?? he said. The dancer??s costumes were designed by the Studio XO, which had collected the data on the physical attributes of each dancer through its wearable technology and applied it to each costume. The music was done by ambient music duo A Winged Victory for the Sullen, which McGregor said would ??take you to another world?? in a different kind of sensory experience. Atomos is also known for demonstrating 3-D graphics on stage, designed by artist Ravi Deepres. Its Seoul performance was part of British Council??s ??UK/Korea 2017-18?? program that will bring the UK??s latest arts and creative projects here. The show will be held 8 p.m. Friday and 5 p.m. Saturday at LG Arts Center in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and tickets range from 40,000 won to 80,000 won.For more information, call (02) 2005-0114 or visit www.lgart.com.By Yoon Min-sik(minsikyoon@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: CHOREOGRAPHY (90%); ARTISTS & PERFORMERS (90%); DANCE (90%); COSTUME & SET DESIGN (89%); DANCERS (89%); FILM (89%); WEARABLE COMPUTERS (78%); VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (78%); NEUROSCIENCE (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (75%); WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY (73%); SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY FILMS (66%); MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS (60%); PRESS CONFERENCES (56%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (55%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (55%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (87%)LOAD-DATE: May 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

It takes them on average 23 years to rise through the ranks of a company and reach the CEO position.According to monthly business magazine The New Management, Monday, the average age of 123 CEOs including co-CEOs in the nation's top 100 companies was 60.6. It was the first time the average age passed 60 in the 23 years since The New Management started collecting related data in 1994.'The data shows Korean companies are reluctant to change their CEOs when facing external uncertainties,' the magazine noted.'The nation has faced a number of unstable external factors increasing market uncertainty such as the IMF crisis in 1997 and the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. Companies tend to maintain the status quo in management when external factors become unstable. It leads to longer terms for company CEOs.'Likewise, a number of top Korean companies decided to keep their CEOs this year.The nation's largest steelmaker POSCO decided to appoint incumbent CEO Kwon Oh-joon to serve another three-year term. Undergoing a massive restructuring process which includes selling non-core assets and saving costs amid the slowdown in the global steel industry, POSCO seems to have chosen stability over change. Kwon is 66.The trend is also evident in the electronics industry.SK hynix Vice Chairman Park Sung-wook, who has served the company as CEO since 2013, was reappointed for another term at the company's general shareholders' meeting last December. Park will also be 60 next year.Of the 123 CEOs, 40.8 percent were born in Seoul while 24.6 percent graduated from Seoul National University (SNU).It also shows that 22.3 percent of them majored in economics.The ratio of SNU-graduated CEOs was at its peak in 1994, accounting for 53.9 percent, but it has since declined every year to hit 24.6 percent this year.Of the 123 CEOs, 61, or 50.4 percent, had science and engineering-related majors while 43 CEOs studied business and 11 had social science-related majors.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: EXECUTIVES (91%); COMPANY LISTS & RANKINGS (90%); IRON & STEEL MILLS (90%); DIVESTITURES (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); TRENDS (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (74%); SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS (73%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); ELECTRONICS (73%); CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING (72%); ENGINEERING (71%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (62%)COMPANY: POSCO (55%)TICKER: PKX (NYSE) (55%); PIDD (LSE) (55%); 5412 (TSE) (55%); 005490 (KSE) (55%)INDUSTRY: NAICS331222 STEEL WIRE DRAWING (55%); NAICS331221 ROLLED STEEL SHAPE MANUFACTURING (55%); NAICS331110 IRON & STEEL MILLS & FERROALLOY MANUFACTURING (55%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (87%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: April 25, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

It is the first biosimilar copy of Herceptin to obtain such backing in Europe.According to protocol, the European Commission is set to follow the EMA's opinion by issuing marketing approval in around two to three months, upon which Samsung Bioepis can begin selling Ontruzant in European markets. Samsung's partner Merck & Co. is set to take charge of the drug's marketing.The EMA's endorsement sets Samsung Bioepis on track to bringing the first biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) to Europe and challenging sales of Herceptin, which generated around $6.8 billion in global revenue for Roche in 2016.'We are proud to see Ontruzant become the first trastuzumab biosimilar recommended for approval in Europe, where breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer affecting women,ï'said Samsung Bioepis CEO Ko Han-sung. 'If approved, we hope Ontruzant will play an important role in expanding patient access to trastuzumab across the region,ï'Ko said.Samsung Bioepis is closely being followed by competitors, including Korea's Celltrion as well as Mylan and Biocon, which have each submitted their own Herceptin copy for approval by the EMA. However, Mylan and Biocon are reportedly facing delays in approval due to manufacturing issues. The EMA's backing of Ontruzant also signals a new feat for Samsung Bioepisï'drug pipeline, as it is the firm's first cancer-targeting drug to be close to regulatory approval.Samsung has so far commercialized three biosimilar drugs in Europe, referencing Remicade, Enbrel and Humira. They are all anti-TNF therapies targeting autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.Friday's development also led local analysts to raise their target stock price for Samsung BioLogics, the parent company of Samsung Bioepis, on Monday. Shares of Samsung BioLogics hit an all-time high of 333,500 won before closing at 328,500 on the day, up 0.61 percent from the previous trading day. ã€€Samsung Bioepis was founded in 2012 as a joint venture between contract drug manufacturer Samsung BioLogics and US drugmaker Biogen.

Son Kum-ju.'The government should figure out who should be held accountable for the repeated mistakes in personnel appointments and take disciplinary action. Unless presidential aides unveil the verification process and take responsibility, this catastrophic conduct will be repeated and the people will have to suffer again.'The minor opposition Justice Party echoed this view. Chairwoman Rep. Lee Jeong-mi called for a total overhaul of Cheong Wa Dae's personnel management system, calling Park a 'nominee that would have been seen in the era of the ousted former leader Park Geun-hye.''Of the numerous controversies, we particularly cannot accept the view that the country was founded in 1948 as it denies the spirit of the Constitution and disqualifies him from being a high-level public official, not to mention it goes against President Moon Jae-in's speech on Aug. 15 National Liberation Day,' she said.'Appointment of Park means damage of the public trust in Moon and a betrayal of his own philosophy of state management. His nomination should be withdrawn immediately.'The 49-year-old professor of engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) was nominated last week as the first minister of the newly formed Ministry of SMEs and Startups under the Moon administration.His nomination was soon embroiled in controversy after it was unveiled he cited the nation was founded in 1948, a minor view strongly advocated by the ousted former leader Park Geun-hye and her supporters, in a 2015 research report. Moon has clarified his view that the national foundation dates back to 1919, when the Provisional Government of Korea was established in Shanghai.It was also controversial that he said dictatorship was inevitable under the Syngman Rhee administration to establish a liberal democracy system.The nominee has been grilled over allegations that two of his three children have dual Korean and American nationality and that his wife committed tax evasion by signing a 'down contract,' where she falsely reported the price of an apartment.His previous position as director of the well-known pseudoscience institute, Korea Association for Creation Research, also sparked controversy.The institute advocates creation science, which started in the U.S. in the 1960s and is regarded as a fundamentalist Christian movement, denying the theory of evolution and considering Biblical creationism to be scientifically proven fact.Park defended himself in a press conference later in the day, saying he is not politically biased. But he showed no intention of stepping down.'I apologize to the people for disturbances surrounding my past deeds,' he said.'It's embarrassing to say but I had not seriously considered my political and ideological orientation before my nomination.'Stressing he had no knowledge of the New Right movement, Park said, 'My acts and thoughts are not much different to what the Moon administration does.'Amid brewing controversies of the nominee, a Cheong Wa Dae official told reporters Wednesday, 'We take the issue seriously. We are checking if he truly made the remark and has such a belief by looking into other materials.'In a Realmeter poll released earlier in the day, Moon's approval rating stood at 73.4 percent of respondents, down 1 percentage point from a week earlier. The controversy over the recent nomination of Park may have affected the people's sentiment toward the Moon administration, the pollster said.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); HISTORY (89%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); DICTATORSHIPS (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); ETHICS (77%); DEMOCRACIES (77%); SCANDALS (77%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); FRAUD & FINANCIAL CRIME (76%); TAX FRAUD (76%); HUMAN RESOURCES (74%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); LIBERALISM (71%); CITIZENSHIP (70%); TAX LAW (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)PERSON: MOON JAE-IN (93%); PARK GEUN-HYE (92%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); SHANGHAI, CHINA (50%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); CHINA (79%)LOAD-DATE: August 31, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Praising the local government??s decision to retire old nuclear reactors and stop building new ones, the top environmental activist also stressed the importance of a national effort to save energy and the need to craft polices in a clear and transparent manner to benefit all, not a select few with vested interests. ??Korea is shifting away from dirty fossil fuel to make change. It will be a real opportunity,?? Morgan said in an interview in Seoul on Wednesday.???Making transition to renewable energy is a good start but it can go even further. The key is to get the right policy to make sure that benefits go to the people.?? Going 100 percent renewable is what Greenpeace asks for from all countries, governments and companies around the world, Morgan said. Nuclear energy and climate change are the two biggest threats to humanity, requiring efforts on all levels and fronts, she went on. ??Climate change should not be something political. It should be about us, our kids, nieces and nephews.?? The top environmental activist was in South Korea on a five-day visit, meeting policymakers and administers interested in environmental issues. Among them were Gangwon Province Gov. Choi Moon-soon, South Chungcheong Gov. Ahn Hee-jung and Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. ??I think it is important that those governors are linked in with others who try to move forward. They are key players, not only nationally but also globally as well,?? she said.On Wednesday, Morgan gave a lecture at Ewha Womans University on Wednesday, saying the massive impeachment protests last winter were ??inspiring?? for activists around the world to see. ??By looking at photos and news showing people power, I noticed the evolution of democracy, which is a type of people power that Greenpeace relates to,?? Morgan said. ??You would not know how connected you are to other groups around the world.??Founded by Canadian and US environmental activists in 1971, Greenpeace has over 3 million supporters worldwide. It has presence in 55 countries, operating 26 regional offices. In Asia, it has four offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei and Seoul. Although Seoul office is relatively young, established in 2011, there is ??so much occurring?? here, Morgan said. Since South Korea is home to high-tech and IT companies, it should challenge the industry by showing the way to recycle gadgets, like smartphones, Morgan said. Globally, the IT industry is making a green revolution, she added.??Committed to 100 percent renewable energy values, IT companies like Apple, Google, Facebook have moved to solve their IT waste issues and they support related laws to get passed,?? Morgan said. On the US?? recent pullout from the Paris Agreement, the Greenpeace chief said it was wrong. ??He (US President Donald Trump) was so inaccurate,?? she said, ??Trump is holding back other Americans who want to move forward.??By Kim Da-sol (ddd@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (84%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (78%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATION (78%); AGREEMENTS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (77%); INTERVIEWS (73%); DEMOCRACIES (72%); GOVERNORS (70%); US PRESIDENTS (61%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (60%); SMARTPHONES (60%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (60%)COMPANY: APPLE INC (60%); FACEBOOK INC (50%)ORGANIZATION: GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL (94%)TICKER: AAPL (NASDAQ) (60%); FB (NASDAQ) (50%)INDUSTRY: NAICS423430 COMPUTER & COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT & SOFTWARE MERCHANT WHOLESALERS (60%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (60%); NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING (60%); SIC5045 COMPUTERS & COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT & SOFTWARE (60%); SIC3572 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICES (60%); SIC3571 ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS (60%); NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (50%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (50%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (91%); BEIJING, CHINA (69%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (96%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); CANADA (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); HONG KONG (79%); ASIA (79%); CHINA (69%)LOAD-DATE: July 13, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

It also runs a semiconductor factory in Austin, Texas, which is focused on system semiconductors.It also laid the foundation for a more stable supply of memory products to its customers.Samsung accounted for 37.1 percent of the global NAND flash market in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to market tracker DRAM eXchange. The NAND flash memory is used to store data on mobile devices like smartphones.In addition, Samsung is projected to emerge as the world's No. 1 player in the chip industry over Intel, according to industry tracker IC Insights.It forecast that Samsung may post sales of $14.9 billion in the second quarter hovering above Intel's estimated $14.4 billion.Big social contributorSamsung offers its Smart School program to migrant children in China to bridge the IT accessibility gap between social classes and foster creative talent by providing digital tools like TVs, laptops and tablets as support-teaching equipment.The environment of the Samsung Smart School not only allows students and teachers to better connect and communicate via tech devices, but also provides opportunities for marginalized students to build IT expertise, an essential employability skill, according to Samsung, which runs the program globally.The company also launched the first Samsung Tech Institute in 2014 in Tianjin to provide electronic maintenance classes to students at vocational schools. Since then, eight Samsung Tech Institutes are in operation in China, which sees a growing interest in technology and job training. Samsung believes that these institutes, aimed at fostering a young and innovative workforce, will help address youth unemployment and improve awareness about technical jobs.The company hopes that those programs will give equal opportunities to all individuals, regardless of their geographic location, educational background or financial situation.Samsung's global scientific innovation contest, the Solve for Tomorrow, began in China in 2013, drawing tremendous interest from Chinese high school and university students.The annual program was designed to give students a platform to generate creative ideas, think outside the box and raise enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.Samsung's first SONO Schools in China opened in 2013 in Guizhou and Shanxi provinces, considering that the country's western provinces had low life expectancy and high infant and maternal mortality. It also plans to set up more schools in the country.In order to lower maternal complications and mortality, the SONO School is found to help doctors to improve their skills related to pre-natal ultrasound devices.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (90%); COMPUTER & ELECTRONICS MFG (90%); BUSINESS ETHICS & CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP (90%); WIRELESS INDUSTRY (90%); SMARTPHONES (89%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (89%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (89%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (78%); CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MFG (78%); TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT MFG (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (77%); CONSUMERS (75%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (73%); CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (73%); STREAMING MEDIA (60%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (60%); INTERNET VIDEO (60%); VIRTUAL REALITY (60%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (58%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD (92%); SAMSUNG GROUP (58%)TICKER: SMSN (LSE) (92%); 005930 (KSE) (92%)INDUSTRY: NAICS334310 AUDIO & VIDEO EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (58%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (58%)CITY: BEIJING, CHINA (88%)STATE: NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (93%)COUNTRY: CHINA (99%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%)LOAD-DATE: June 15, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The soap opera is said to be the next 'Dae Jang Geum.'But after some initial hype and much publicity, the drama has fast been losing its appeal.The initial two episodes posted relatively good viewership of 15.5 percent and 16.3 percent, topping viewership among dramas in the same time slot by a large margin.However, the third episode slipped to 13 percent and then its fourth episode to 12.3 percent, overtaken by MBC's workplace comedy 'Good Manager.'It is still too early to talk about whether the drama will be a flop or not, but the 20 billion won production seems to lack fresh elements to lure viewers.From the onset, the drama - the story of Shin Saimdang, a Joseon-era artist and writer - looked like it was about actress Lee, by Lee, and for Lee.When the drama had its premiere, the actress looked as beautiful as her earlier days on screen. But the drama seems outdated.Its main time-slip element, which could have been fresh if it was aired last year, looks too familiar, after recent dramas like 'Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo' and 'Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.'Apart from product placements spotted here and there from the first episode, including a juice mixer and a restaurant, its story leans too much on fortunate events lacking reasonable explanations.Lee plays a double role of a modern art history instructor So Ji-yoon and the Joseon-era artist Saimdang herself.Modern-day So, who has done all the chores of her academic adviser to land a professorial position at university, loses favor and her adviser kicks her out of an art forum in Italy.But she happens to receive an old book from a street vendor. Then, while on her way to find a place referred to in the book, she finds a mirror.The mirror suddenly breaks and reveals a chest. Inside she finds a painting of a woman who looks like her and what is believed to be Saimdang's diary. The host gives her the painting and the book, saying they are meant to belong to her.While she is having a hard time interpreting the old script in the book, a neighbor who teaches Chinese writing comes to help her. Although it is fantasy, the way it was presented has left viewers at a loss.Lee's acting did not help. The actress, who debuted in the 1993 drama 'How's Your Husband?' has never been a particularly good actress. Even in the mega hit 'Dae Jang Geum' which lifted her to pan-Asian stardom, her acting was not particularly good.'Saimdang' seems to be leaning on star power only, but this is not enough. Her performance fails to engage viewers in her character.Lee's other role, as the Joseon-era Saimdang, did not prove compelling, either.Because the series was completed before its premiere, making it impossible for changes to reflect viewers' opinions, the future looks distinctly gloomy.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HISTORY (89%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (89%); ART HISTORY (89%); MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS (70%); WRITERS (69%); ACADEMIC COUNSELING (63%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (60%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (91%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (72%)LOAD-DATE: February 3, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

(Yonhap)The incident sparked global furor after Malaysian authorities announced VX, a nerve agent banned under international law, was used to kill him.""The US has been looking into the issue since it lifted North Korea from the list in 2008, but I've learned that it began considering relisting due to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam,"" the official told reporters after the meeting.Calls have been growing for the redesignation as the communist state spurs its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international resolutions.Washington blacklisted the North in 1988 following its midair bombing of a Korean Air passenger plane, killing all 115 aboard, but removed it from the list in 2008 as nuclear negotiations got under way.Any return to the list would make Pyongyang subject to further sanctions on trade, investment, assistance, financial transactions and other engagement with the outside world.A bipartisan bill calling for the blacklisting has already been proposed to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee. But the possibility remains slim, as it requires meticulous proof of a state's terror-related activities.""Our side underscored the killing was a serious breach of international norms given a banned chemical weapon was employed, and the international community should respond strongly to this as it constituted a crime against humanity and human rights,"" said Kim Hong-kyun, special representative for the Korean Peninsula's peace and security affairs at the Foreign Ministry here.VX is prohibited under the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. It is deemed one of the most lethal and fastest-acting substances in chemical warfare, far stronger than sarin.Since the murder, Seoul has been stepping up efforts to increase pressure on the Kim Jong-un regime and draw the international community's stern responses, focusing on the suspected use of VX.South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, for his part, raised his voice on the issue at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, following his participation in the UN Human Rights Council meeting a day earlier.During the trilateral meeting, the nuclear envoys issued a statement lambasting Pyongyang's ""flagrant disregard"" of UN Security Council resolutions warranting ""strong international pressure on the regime.""While refraining from addressing the murder directly, they pointed to the North's unabated violations of human rights and signaled the possibility for additional individual sanctions""The officials considered other possible measures under national authorities, including means to restrict further the revenue sources for North Korea's weapons programs, particularly illicit activities,"" the statement said.By Shin Hyon-hee (heeshin@heraldcorp.cLANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); TERRORISM (90%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (90%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (89%); CHEMICAL & BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS (89%); ARMS CONTROL & DISARMAMENT (89%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS (89%); CHEMICAL & BIOLOGICAL TERRORISM (89%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (89%); LAW OF WAR (88%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (88%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (88%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (78%); LEGISLATION (78%); UNITED NATIONS (78%); CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (78%); BOMBINGS (78%); MISSILE SYSTEMS (77%); DISARMAMENT (77%); MILITARY WEAPONS (75%); MISSILE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (75%); ILLEGAL WEAPONS (75%); US CONGRESS (73%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (72%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (70%); AIRLINES (69%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (67%); MURDER (58%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (58%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); UNITED STATES (94%); MALAYSIA (93%); JAPAN (92%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%); SWITZERLAND (75%)LOAD-DATE: February 28, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

THE KOREA HERALD September 4, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDSeptember 4, 2017 Monday?Turkey, lasting bulwark against global terrorism, extremism? LENGTH: 517 wordsAmid celebrations of 60 years of official diplomacy with Korea, the Turkish Embassy on Wednesday observed its national holiday -- Victory Day -- and paid tribute to the triumph against occupying Greek forces in the Battle of Dumlupinar on Aug. 30, 1922, which helped create a modern, republican nation state. During a reception in Seoul, Turkish Ambassador to Korea Arslan Hakan Okcal also noted the thriving strategic partnership since 2012 between Ankara and Seoul, as the two nations have bolstered their cooperation politically, economically, culturally as well as militarily to counter rising threats of terrorism and nuclear proliferation. ??The victory in 1922 not only ended the foreign occupation of our country under Western imperial powers after the First World War, but also led to the foundation of a modern republic based on international values of democracy and secularism as championed by Ataturk, the father of all Turks,?? the envoy said in a speech. The guiding principle of Turkey??s foreign policy -- ??peace at home, peace in the world?? -- as enshrined in the constitution, originated from Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (1881-1938), an army officer, revolutionary, and founder and first president of Turkey from 1923 through 1938, according to Okcal.The ambassador highlighted that the Turkish army has faithfully performed its duties endowed upon it by the constitution, protecting the country??s democracy, secularism, rule of law and justice. It has also defended and upheld democracies of the West as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he added. ??The immediate vicinity of Turkey??s southeastern borders are marred by war and vicious crimes committed against humanity. Terrorism, extremism, ethnic and religious hatred and sectarianism are ravaging this region with dangerous spillover effects on Turkey,?? he stressed, adding the Turkish army is fighting against all terror groups and living up to its international responsibilities as a coalition and NATO member.Pointing to last year??s failed putsch by coup plotters -- inspired by the Fethullah Gulen Terror Organization -- Okcal said 250 Turkish citizens lost their lives and key edifices like the Turkish Grand National Assembly and the Presidential Palace in Ankara were destroyed, but the revolt was forestalled by brave citizens who took to the streets against the mutineers. Okcal honored his fallen forebears of the 1950-53 Korean War, to which Turkey sent 21,000 troops to defend South Korea??s freedom and democracy from North Korea??s invasion. Nearly 1,000 Turkish soldiers lost their lives and some 1,400 sustained injuries from the war. ??Many of our fallen heroes are eternally resting in peace on Korean soil with their Korean brothers. That is why our nations call each other ??blood brothers?? -- a testament to our special friendship,?? the diplomat underlined. The envoy admonished North Korea for escalating tensions in the peninsula with its nuclear and missile provocations. He urged the communist country to return to dialogue for lasting peace and security.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: DEMOCRACIES (90%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (90%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (90%); TERRORISM (90%); ARMIES (90%); COUNTERTERRORISM (90%); WAR & CONFLICT (90%); TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (89%); COUPS (89%); CHURCH & STATE (88%); RELIGION (88%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); FOREIGN POLICY (78%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (78%); HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (78%); KOREAN WAR (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); RACE & ETHNICITY (78%); PEACE PROCESS (78%); MILITARY OCCUPATIONS (77%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (76%); ARMS CONTROL & DISARMAMENT (75%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (74%); RULE OF LAW (73%); WORLD WAR I (72%); ARMED FORCES (71%); RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION (68%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (56%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (50%)ORGANIZATION: NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (54%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (92%); ANKARA, TURKEY (90%)COUNTRY: TURKEY (98%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (93%)LOAD-DATE: September 4, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

His speech came on the occasion of his receiving an honorary doctoral degree from the university. / Courtesy of SUNYLTI president gives commencement speech at SUNYKim Seong-kon, president of Literature Translation Institute Korea (LTI Korea), said his father was the key inspiration for his lifetime endeavor to support cross-cultural understanding.In a speech at the commencement ceremony of the College of Arts and Sciences at State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo on May 19, Kim said just as his father did as an interpreter, he has striven to play a role to connect different cultures all during his life _ like father, like son.The only difference is that his father fulfilled the role when the nation was in extreme turmoil from a series of political upheavals but his son was fortunate in that he was able to pursue his cultural ambassador-like mission after stability came to the nation.His father, who studied law, served as an English translator for the U.S. Military Government in Korea in 1945 when Korea gained independence after 36 years of Japanese occupation and he stayed there all through the Korean War.Kim, a former dean and professor emeritus of Seoul National University, quoted his father as saying, 'In times of crisis, the most important thing in life is to help different people understand each other.' He said his father chose to become an interpreter, not a lawyer, for this reason.'When I first saw the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey, that connected Asia to Europe, I was fascinated by the symbolism of the bridge,' he said. 'Crossing the bridge, I told myself, I should be like this bridge, connecting the East and the West. Ever since, I have always tried to become a bridge, an interpreter and a cultural ambassador between East and West and between Korea and America.'LTI Korea is responsible for transmitting Korean ideas and thoughts overseas and has translated selected Korean literary works into many languages, including English, Spanish and French, to give international readers access to Korean literature in their languages. The state-sponsored institution's translations have helped several Korean writers earn international fame when their works captivated the hearts of foreign readers.Kim took the helm of LTI Korea in 2012 and was reappointed as its president in 2015.Kim's speech came on the occasion of his receiving of an honorary doctorate from SUNY at Buffalo for his life-long devotion to bridging cultural gaps. He is the third Korean to receive an honorary doctoral degree from SUNY at Buffalo, following former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Lee Myung-bak.Mentioning his first arrival in Buffalo in 1978 when he was in his 20s, he called the city his second hometown and compared his reunion with the city to receive the honorary doctoral degree something akin to a 'homecoming.''Now I have returned here in my late 60s, accomplishing what great American poet Walt Whitman once described as a roundure complete.

I think I was destined to work at Hyundai (as a car designer),"" said Park who was then a designer at a local electronics company. ""Nothing is stronger than the power of destiny.""South Korea's first auto designer Park Jong-suh speaks at FOMA, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, where he displayed bodies of classic cars from Ferraris to the Hyundai Pony, recreated in metal and wooden frames, Monday. (Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)ã  The year 1974 was one year before Hyundai Motor, then a tiny carmaker, built the first Korean-developed automobile, Pony.The hatchback compact car opened the door for Hyundai to grow, but on the other hand, most of it was not made in Korea.Pony originated from Hyundai Motor, now the world's fifth-largest carmaker, but the car itself was a mere collaboration of foreign technology and funds at that time, with a design from Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign, transmission and engine from Mitsubishi, machine press from France and funds from Barclays Banks.After the launch of Pony, the mission Park faced was clear: Create the design identity and originality of the South Korean carmaker.But there was nothing to learn about automobile design in Korea, simply because there was no such course available. Park left for the Royal College of Arts for a yearlong course -- his first proper education on car design. He was the first Korean to attend the British school.After years of self-learning, Park's first design, Hyundai's Scoupe, hit the market in 1990. However, he was still unsatisfied.""We felt so embarrassed when we had to present our works at motor shows because everyone participating in the shows were better than us,"" he said. ""Hyundai was not good enough to take the lead at that time. The carmaker lacked engine technology. But design was what Hyundai could do better.""In 1992, his concept car titled ""HCD 1,"" a two-seat sports vehicle with a bold design, won the best concept car award at the Detroit Motor Show. Feeling more confident, Park successfully presented Tiburon in 1996, another sports car, and the sports utility vehicle Santa Fe in 2000.Sonata was a hit, helping Hyundai gain more presence in the global market in the 1990s.In recognition of his contribution to South Korea's automobile industry, he received a presidential merit in 1993 and the Brass-Tower Industry Prize in 1999.(Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)Though Park had no predecessor in his home country in terms of auto design, nature has always been his teacher and inspiration.The two vehicles, Tiburon and Santa Fe, famous for their bold curves and volume, were inspired by photography of masculine whales jumping from the sea of Alaska, he said.""People today believe that they can do anything with computers. But in order to design an excellent car, you need to go back to the basic, by observing the beauty of nature and the form the nature produces.""Park's career as the head designer of Hyundai Motor ended in 2004, due to his health.Shortly after his retirement, he hit the road to meet Italian artisans who create original bodies for commercial cars. The former vice president of Hyundai's design institute said he was shocked at discovering the aesthetic curves of cars like Ferrari were created not by drawing on paper or computers, but by artisans striking hammers on metal plates for years.""I discovered, after spending years as car designer, that the cars of excellent designs were born by sheet metal molded into the curvaceous shapes and lines of our imaginations. I wanted to let my junior designers know that even in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which is said to be propelled by artificial intelligence, nothing can go beyond the creations of human senses,"" he said.Park's discovery in Italy led him to open a private museum on cars and arts in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.(Park Hyun-koo/The Korea Herald)A 1,300 meter-square building, named Form of Motors and Arts, or FOMA, is Park's new studio, arts school and gallery for his collection of cars and designs inspired by the nature. In the museum, Park placed not only the Tiburon repainted in chameleonic green but also the Pony in a wooden frame.Reproducing the car bodies is his way of rediscovering the beauty of car as an art form and proving his belief that such art forms came from nature.""If FOMA becomes a place where young designers get inspiration and become creative, I would want nothing more,"" said Park, who built the museum with $5 billion won of investment from his own pocket.""This is also a place for children so that they can think out of box, get more creative and learn something other than what textbooks teach.""Amid the fast evolving car industry through the development of technology, Park said car designs should become more simple and better portray the designs of nature.""I think cars today have too much unnecessary design and functions.

"491","Samsung Bioepis-AbbVie Humira patent trial in UK to start Monday",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"January","Samsung Bioepis-AbbVie Humira patent trial in UK to start Monday   THE KOREA HERALD January 17, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDJanuary 17, 2017 TuesdaySamsung Bioepis-AbbVie Humira patent trial in UK to start Monday LENGTH: 981 wordsThe UK High Court of Justice will commence Monday its trial on Samsung Bioepis and Biogen's lawsuit against AbbVie and its patents for its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, according to official court documents obtained by The Korea Herald.ã€€Japanese drugmaker Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics (FKB) will also be taking on AbbVie in the same trial, as a claimant siding with Samsung Bioepis and Biogen.ã€€According to a ruling by Justice Henry Carr last month, which was made available on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute, the trial will take place Monday at the Patents Court, which handles intellectual property disputes under the High Court in London.A Samsung Bioepis employee works in a lab at the company's headquarters in Songdo, Incheon (Samsung Bioepis)ã€€Samsung Bioepis and FKB have asked the court to invalidate AbbVie's ""overlapping"" secondary patents for Humira so they can launch biosimilar versions of Humira (adalimumab) once the drug's main patents expire in 2018.ã€€Biosimilars are cheaper, near replicas of biologic drugs that have lost patent protection -- which firms such as Samsung Bioepis have been working to develop.ã€€AbbVie's composition patent on Humira is set to expire in Europe in 2018. However, the US pharmaceutical giant has been filing new patents over the drug's ""indications"" -- uses for treating particular diseases -- and other usage considerations to fend off biosimilars.ã€€Samsung Bioepis and its partner and minority shareholder Biogen filed a lawsuit in the UK in March last year, challenging the validity of such new patents registered by AbbVie.ã€€Humira is the world's best-selling drug for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, generating worldwide revenues of more than $14 billion for AbbVie in 2015.ã€€AbbVie CEO and Chairman Richard Gonzalez has repeatedly pledged to aggressively challenge copies of its top-valued drug, saying that the company's series of patents covering Humira will extend its exclusive status against biosimilars until at least 2022.ã€€A win for the Samsung company would pave the way for the Korean drugmaker and others to commercialize its Humira biosimilar in the UK as well as other European markets -- as the UK ruling could impact future patent jurisdictions in neighboring countries.ã€€Samsung Bioepis' Humira-referencing biosimilar, SB5, was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency, Europe's drug regulatory body, in July 2016.ã€€Samsung Bioepis could not be reached for comment. AbbVie declined to comment on the case, saying it ""does not comment on specific litigation"" when previously contacted by The Korea Herald.ã€€Lead up to trialã€€ã€€Months ahead of the upcoming trial, AbbVie had apparently attempted to settle the suit and end the UK-based proceedings, according to the court documents.ã€€In November last year, the US drugmaker had asked the three biosimilar companies to drop the proceedings in the UK in return for AbbVie abandoning its rights to the patents they were challenging.ã€€Samsung Bioepis and FKB did not accept this proposition, calling for a definitive judgment on this case.ã€€According to court papers summarizing Justice Carr's ruling on the need to continue this trial, the claimants argued that AbbVie's actions reflect its ""well-established strategy"" of dragging out patent proceedings for as long as possible, abandoning its patent rights at the last minute and then filing new, similar patents.ã€€Such conduct allows AbbVie to avoid courts from invalidating the US drugmaker's overlapping patents and removing uncertainty for the future release of biosimilars in the UK and other European markets, the claimants said.ã€€AbbVie had argued that a trial was unnecessary as it had already offered to give up its rights to the patents in dispute, clearing the way for the complainants to market their biosimilars in the future, according to the judge's note.ã€€However, the UK High Court dismissed AbbVie's request to suspend the trial, as Justice Carr appears to have recognized the validity of the complainants' arguments.ã€€""The judge at trial may well conclude that AbbVie has consistently adopted a policy of publicly expressing its confidence in its Humira patent portfolio, and its intention to enforce it against competition from biosimilars, while at the same time shielding patents within the portfolio from scrutiny by the court,"" Carr said.ã€€""It may be considered that AbbVie is 'willing to wound and yet afraid to strike' and that the time has come to put its professed confidence in its ability to prevent biosimilar competition to the test,"" he added.ã€€AbbVie's patent fight continues in USã€€ã€€In addition to the upcoming trial in the UK, AbbVie is engaged in other patent disputes over Humira in the US -- one with Coherus Biosciences and another with Amgen.ã€€AbbVie's composition patent on Humira expired in the US in December 2016, but the firm has filed multiple new additional patents to extend the drug's patent life in the country.ã€€In Amgen's case, it has already secured the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of Amjevita, its Humira-referencing biosimilar. Yet the company most likely will not be able to commercialize Amjevita within this year, as AbbVie has filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement.ã€€Though it has yet to take legal action in the US, Samsung Bioepis is preparing to debut its Humira biosimilar in the US market as well. It has already completed SB5's phase III clinical trials in the US, according to the US National Institutes of Health's ClinicalTrials.gov.ã€€Samsung Bioepis is a subsidiary of Samsung BioLogics, a contract drug manufacturer which went public in November last year. Together, the two Samsung units are leading the group's push into new, promising industries that could supplement its flagship electronics business.ã€€By Sohn Ji-young (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: PATENTS (93%); PATENT LAW (90%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (90%); PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); SUITS & CLAIMS (89%); RHEUMATIC DISEASES (89%); ARTHRITIS (89%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (89%); LITIGATION (89%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (89%); BIOTECHNOLOGY PATENTS (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (78%); PATENT INVALIDATION & REVOCATION (78%); PHARMACEUTICALS PATENTS (78%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (77%); PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MFG (76%); EXECUTIVES (50%); SHAREHOLDERS (50%)COMPANY: SAMSUNG GROUP (93%); BIOGEN IDEC INC (92%); ABBVIE INC (90%)TICKER: BIIB (NASDAQ) (92%); ABBV (PAR) (90%); ABBV (NYSE) (90%)INDUSTRY: NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325510 PAINT & COATING MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325211 PLASTICS MATERIAL & RESIN MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (93%); NAICS236220 COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION (93%); NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS541720 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES & HUMANITIES (92%); NAICS325414 BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (EXCEPT DIAGNOSTIC) MANUFACTURING (92%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (73%); INCHON, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (56%)COUNTRY: UNITED KINGDOM (95%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%); NORTHERN ASIA (90%); EUROPE (88%)LOAD-DATE: January 17, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

This population issue has emerged as a topic that students, who will be affected in the future, should discuss now,â€ said Lee Bo-kyung, 17, in a forum at Daewon Girlsâ€™ High School in Seoul, Friday.Seventeen senior students made English presentations on various aspects of the issue, ranging from understanding the phenomena of the low birthrate and aging society to efforts in dealing with the problems here and abroad.Koreaâ€™s birthrate was 1.25 in 2016, the lowest among OECD member states, while the average life expectancy was 82.4 years, which is higher than the OECD average.As a means to deal with an aging society, a student brought up Franceâ€™s Delalande contribution, which imposes a penalty for firms dismissing workers over age 50 to protect employment of older workers.In order to tackle the birthrate, one student mentioned Singaporeâ€™s state education encouraging childbirth. However, another said a more fundamental approach would be to address the structural problems of the labor market which makes childbirth unfeasible, citing the â€œSuperwoman Prevention Law,â€ an election pledge by Rep. Sim Sang-jung of the minority Justice Party. The law centers on adjusting the period of maternity and paternity leave and pay provided during leave, as well as working hours, in order to ease the burden of childcare and increase menâ€™s participation.â€œThe reality is men account for only 5.6 percent those taking childcare leave,â€ Lee Yeong-eun said.The presentations were made based on five months of research, script writing and practice. Students interviewed teachers for insight and conducted student surveys on their perceptions of childbirth.â€œWe put in several hours a day for months to prepare for the forum,â€ Lee Bo-kyung said. â€œI think it was a good opportunity to think about the population problem Korea faces, and also study English.â€The forum was attended by teachers of neighboring schools as well as the studentsâ€™ parents.Daewon Girlsâ€™ High School teacher Lee Kyung-man, who has taught English for over 30 years, is in charge of the extracurricular English classes in which the students held the forum.Four years ago, Lee initiated the advanced English class at the school, in which students read English books, write English essays and practice English debate.So far, students have covered topics such as welfare and global warming, as well as theories on utilitarianism and justice.â€œThe era of teaching English and correcting studentsâ€™ mistakes is over. English must be a tool through which students explore the humanities and social and natural science,â€ teacher Lee said.â€œHigh school education and problems in society are not separate; students should learn to think about issues as they study.â€LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (93%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); AGING (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); BIRTHS & BIRTH RATES (90%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (89%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (89%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (86%); FAMILY LEAVE (86%); SINGLE SEX EDUCATION (78%); SOCIETAL ISSUES (76%); OLDER WORKERS (73%); MATERNITY LEAVE (70%); LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE (70%); MEN (69%); POLITICAL PARTIES (69%); PATERNITY LEAVE (67%); DISMISSALS (65%); CHILD CARE (61%); FINES & PENALTIES (51%)ORGANIZATION: ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION & DEVELOPMENT (82%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (90%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)LOAD-DATE: April 5, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

Nowell moved to Korea in 1965 and has worked in community relations and public affairs for the USFK Yongsan command before retiring. Park, after auditioning, first performed on Yongsan for the 1959 Spring Variety Show. He and his bandmate Shin Jung-hyeon later found success in Korea's local music scene. / Courtesy of Coco CugatBy Jon DunbarHartell House, the main officer's club inside Yongsan Garrison in central Seoul, closes its doors for the last time next Wednesday. The single-story building, first constructed in 1912 for the Japanese before U.S. forces took over in 1945, is shutting down in line with the large-scale plan to relocate most of the garrison south to Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, returning the land to Korea after more than a century in foreign hands.This unprecedented move will change the face of Seoul and end a complex historic era. But while many Koreans may be happy to see it go, Daniel Oh and Coco Cugat hurry to record the garrison's history before it's all gone.The husband and wife founded Yongsan Legacy, a virtual monument welcoming stories, photos and memories of the place, people and events. They are currently awaiting designation as a nonprofit organization. They work with volunteer historians tracing all manner of cultural exchanges, including food, music, fashion and art.'Through these stories and photos, Yongsan Legacy hopes to reveal the significance of the Yongsan Garrison and Yongsan area,' said Daniel Oh, an assistant professor of Korea University's architecture department.'The magnitude of Yongsan Garrison's influence on the development of modern South Korea is remarkable and deserves to be recognized; from fashion to K-pop, from friendships to families, from history to ghost stories, Yongsan Garrison offers a unique perspective in understanding Korea today.'Their current plan is to gather information, which will later form a foundation for endeavors by artists, writers, video game programmers and designers, which he hopes will inspire the architects of Yongsan's future.Currently, the city plans to create a massive urban park on the soon-to-be vacated land, demolishing more than 90 percent of the 1,000 existing structures. But Oh urges people to see beyond the physical walls and political barriers to find the base's true historic cultural value.'Almost 70 years of Seoul's rapid growth completely encapsulated the garrison making it an urban archaeological site,' Oh said. 'To many Seoulites, Yongsan Garrison is a black hole sitting in the middle of a megalopolis. Because it was an active military base, everything had to be kept secret.'For seven decades, U.S. military personnel and their families have transformed the base into a microcosm of America, with U.S.-style housing, stores, restaurants, even schools. According to Oh, between 60 and 70 percent of those who've worked on base are Korean, and Yongsan Garrison's influence trickled out into the surrounding city through countless channels.For instance, hundreds of Korean musicians in the 1960s auditioned for the American Forces Korea Network (AFKN) to perform on base, many going on to become Korea's first music superstars. Koreans started many businesses catering to U.S. personnel, selling everything from bottled water and haircuts to artistic portraits and fashion items.'For outsiders, Yongsan Garrison offers an opportunity to see the remarkable progress that Koreans have made since Japanese colonial times,' Oh said, 'and for Korean nationals, the base provides a chance to pause and reflect on their past and appreciate the present day.'Next Monday at 5 p.m., Yongsan Legacy will start its talk series at USO headquarters on Camp Kim, inviting veterans and civilians who served, worked or lived on Yongsan to share their stories.

"494","[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea '",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"February","[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea '  Korea Times February 5, 2017 Sunday   Korea TimesFebruary 5, 2017 Sunday[Q&As] Three scenarios on how AI will affect North Korea 'LENGTH: 2114 wordsThe following is the full the interview with Yuval Noah Harari, author of the international bestsellers 'Sapiens' and 'Homo Deus.' - ED.Q. How do you think that the development of algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), will affect North Korea's political system that is dominated by third-generation dictator Kim Jong-un?A. It could affect it in various and even contradictory ways. One scenario is that the North Korean regime will not be able to adapt to the new realities. Since North Korea at present has no advanced Infotech industry, as AI becomes more and more critical both for the economy and for the military, North Korea might become economically poorer and militarily weaker than ever before. Unable to provide for its own citizens or to blackmail its neighbors, the Kim regime will collapse.Another scenario is that North Korea will leap-frog ahead, becoming for example the first country in the world where all vehicles are self-driving. There are advantages to being an underdeveloped centralized dictatorship. Consider what might happen if South Korea tries to ban human drivers and switch to a completely self-driving transport system. South Korean citizens privately own millions of vehicles, and many might object to losing their freedom and their property. There will also be objections from taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and even traffic cops, who will all lose their jobs. There will be strikes and demonstrations. The initiative could also be forestalled by legal and even philosophical conundrums if a self-driving car causes an accident, whom do you sue? Or suppose a self-driving car lost its breaks due to some malfunction, and has to choose between driving forward and killing five innocent pedestrians, or swerving to the side and endangering its own passengers. What should the car do?In a free market democracy like South Korea, it will not be easy to confront all these challenges. Now consider North Korea. There are very few vehicles there, taxi drivers cannot demonstrate, truck drivers cannot strike, and all legal and philosophical difficulties can be solved in a single afternoon with the stroke of a single pen. You really need to convince just one person, and the country could switch overnight to a fully automatic transport system.A third scenario is that North Korea uses AI to become a full-fledged Orwellian dystopia. Each citizen will be required to wear a biometric device that not only monitors everything you do and say, but could even monitor your blood pressure and brain activity. In Soviet days the KGB could never really know everything about you, and could not be sure what you were thinking, because the KGB did not have the data and the computing power necessary. But using our growing understanding of the human brain, and using the immense powers of machine learning, the North Korean regime might be able for the first time in history to know what each and every citizen is thinking each and every moment. If you look at a picture of Kim Jong-un on the wall, and the biometric sensors pick up the telltale signs of anger (higher blood pressure, increased activity in the amygdala), you'll be in the gulag tomorrow morning.Q. How do you think that the fast rise of AI will affect the South-North relationship?A. In the immediate future, the greatest impact might come from cyberwarfare. The South will face a constant danger of cyber-attacks from the North, and will find it difficult to deter the North from such attacks or retaliate to them. The North's very backwardness will protect it. If the North disrupts online bank services in the South, what will the South do? It cannot disrupt online bank services in the North, because there aren't any. Will it bombard Pyongyang in retaliation?The rise of AI might also make any future integration of North and South more difficult, for both cultural and economic reasons. AI is likely to transform the culture and even psychology of South Koreans, and if North Koreans do not undergo a similar revolution, the gap between the populations would become bigger than ever before. It is beginning to happen even today. Just think of the cultural gap between a South Korean teenager glued to her smartphone, Youtube, Instagram and Twitter and a North Korean teenager who might well be dumbfounded to see people walking down the street and constantly looking at small screens in their palms.As for the economic gap, in the past the South was apprehensive of unification because of the expected economic cost. Nevertheless, there were also potential economic benefits, because the North had one important economic asset to contribute to a united Korea: a disciplined and cheap work force. However, AI is likely to make cheap labor irrelevant. As algorithms and robots replace truck drivers, factory workers and even doctors, cheap labor would lose its value. That might make future integration even harder. South Korea might face a crisis taking care of its own unemployed masses; it will not want to take care of millions of northerners too.Of course there might be positive influences as well. As noted earlier, the profound changes caused by the rise of AI might destabilize the North Korean regime and lead to its collapse, while the South Korean hi-tech industry may generate so much prosperity in the South that it will actually find it easier to integrate the North. Nobody really knows for sure.Q. In your new book the 'Homo Deus,' you talked about ""logic bombs."" Is it safe to assume that North Korea has also installed many logic bombs in South Korea?A. It is extremely likely.Q. How would you evaluate U.S. President Donald Trump's policies such as anti-trade measures (the renegotiation of NAFTA and the KORUS FTA, and the withdrawal from TPP)? How would you evaluate Trump's policies including travel bans on immigrants from Muslim countries and refugees?A. Donald Trump is part of a larger nationalist wave that is sweeping over much of the world. This is a very dangerous development. In the past, nationalism was dangerous because it bred war. In the 21st century, nationalism is even more dangerous, because in addition to fostering wars it is likely to prevent humankind from solving the existential problems we face.Today all our major problems are global in nature: global warming, global inequality, and the rise of disruptive technologies such as AI and bioengineering. In order to face these challenges successfully, we need global cooperation. For example, no nation can regulate bioengineering single-handedly. It won't help much if the US forbids genetically engineering human babies, as long as China or North Korea allows it. Similarly, no nation can stop global warming by itself. Can Donald Trump build a wall against rising oceans? Because nationalism has no answer to global warming, it tends to simply deny the problem. But the problem is real. Hence I think the current wave of nationalism is a kind of escapism: people refusing to confront the unprecedented problems of the twenty-first century by closing their eyes and minds and by seeking a refuge in the fold of traditional local identities. I hope that people will wake up in time. For that, we probably need a new global ideology that can unite humankind.There is still plenty of room in the world for the kind of patriotism that celebrates the uniqueness of my nation and stresses my special obligations towards it. Yet if we want to survive and flourish, humankind has little choice but to complement such local loyalties with substantial obligations towards a global community. If people nevertheless insist that the interests of their nation override all other loyalties and considerations, I would be curious to know how they plan to solve global warming and how they plan to handle the risks of nuclear war, artificial intelligence and biotechnology.Q. Do you think that Google and Baidu are not doing the right thing by collecting personal data and taking advantage of them?A. Collecting and analyzing personal data on billions of people certainly has its advantages, not just to the corporations doing it, but also to the public. It could be used, for example, to provide people with much better healthcare. If Google or Baidu monitors my biometric data and compares it with the biometric data of millions of other people, they could detect the early signs of cancer, when it is possible to nip it in the bud. They could detect the early signs of a flu epidemic, when it is relatively easy to prevent it from spreading. They could alert me that my nutrition is sub-optimal, and tailor a diet for my unique body. I believe that in the 21st century there will be a huge battle between privacy and health, and that most people will choose to sacrifice their privacy for the sake of better healthcare.At the same time, there are obvious dangers inherent in allowing corporations and governments to know so much about us and to monopolize our personal data. Given enough data and enough computing power, external algorithms could know us better than we know ourselves. And then Google, or the government, could predict our decisions, manipulate our emotions, and gain absolute control over our lives. Not just in North Korea, but also in South Korea, Big Data might create a Big Brother that knows everything and controls everything.In ancient times land was the most valuable resource, hence much of politics revolved around the question who owns the land. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution the question became who owns the means of production. In the 21st century the question will be who owns the data. At present, people are giving up their most valuable asset, their personal data, in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. People should be reminded of the famous maxim that 'if you get something for free, you are probably the product'.Q. In the era of a-mortals, whenever it would be, do you think that religions would lose its raison d'etre and disappear? Or it will continue to exist?A. First, we should understand what religion is. Religion is not belief in gods. Rather, religion is any system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in super-human laws. Religion tells us that we must obey certain laws that were not invented by humans, and that humans cannot change at will. Some religions, such as Islam, Christianity and Hinduism, believe that these super-human laws were created by the gods. Other religions, such as Buddhism, Capitalism and Nazism, believe that these super-human laws are natural laws. Thus Buddhists believe in the natural laws of karma, Nazis argued that their ideology reflected the laws of natural selection, and Capitalists believe that they follow the natural laws of economics.No matter whether they believe in divine laws or in natural laws, all religions have exactly the same function: to give legitimacy to human norms and values, and to give stability to human institutions such as states and corporations. Without some kind of religion, it is simply impossible to maintain social order. During the modern era religions that believe in divine laws went into eclipse. But religions that believe in natural laws became ever more powerful. In the future, they are likely to become more powerful yet. Silicon Valley is today a hot-house of new techno-religions. They promise all the old religious prizes ? happiness, peace, prosperity, and eternal life ? but here on earth with the help of technology, rather than after death with the help of celestial beings.Q. Is there anything else you want to comment on to Korean readers?A. I would like to emphasize that technology is never deterministic. We can use the same technological breakthroughs to create very different kinds of societies and situations. For example, in the 20th century people could use the technology of the Industrial Revolution ? trains, electricity, radio, telephone ? in order to create communist dictatorships, fascist regimes or liberal democracies. Just think about South Korea and North Korea: They have had access to exactly the same technology, but they have chosen to employ it in very different ways.In the 21st century the rise of AI and biotechnology will certainly transform the world, but it does not mandate a single deterministic outcome. We can use them to create very different kinds of societies. How to use them wisely is the most important question facing humankind today. It is far more important than the global economic crisis, the wars in the Middle East, or the refugee crisis in Europe. The future not only of humanity, but probably of life itself, depends on how we choose to use AI and biotechnology.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (90%); DICTATORSHIPS (89%); AUTONOMOUS MOTOR VEHICLES (88%); WRITERS (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (77%); BRAIN (77%); DEMOCRACIES (72%); BIOMETRICS (72%); TRUCK DRIVERS (72%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (57%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (94%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%); NORTHERN ASIA (92%)LOAD-DATE: February 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

THE KOREA HERALD July 18, 2017 Tuesday   THE KOREA HERALDJuly 18, 2017 Tuesday[Kim Seong-kon] Be lost in Pastland or prosper in Tomorrowland? LENGTH: 794 wordsIf you ask a scientist, ??What is a star??? he will probably answer, ??It is a gigantic mass of dust located in the universe far away from Earth.?? How unromantic! Yet it is the undeniable truth. In the eyes of a scientist a star is nothing but a round shaped mass of dust, earth and rocks orbiting in the universe in the dark. However, if you asked the same question to a poet or a student of literature or the humanities, the answer would be totally different. He will describe a star as the most gorgeous object he can dream of. And he will use all sorts of romantic words related to stars, such as rising star, shooting star, star-crossed lovers, stardust sky, starry, stellar, and movie star.To a certain extent, it is a matter of reality and fantasy. Scientists observe reality through telescopes and microscopes, whereas writers tend to fantasize. If you fantasize, you do not see the real person or real object. Instead, you only see the beauty created by your fantasy, which is far from reality. However, if you focus only on reality, you will never be able to see the beauty in it. In that sense, it is like the two sides of a coin. At the same time, it could be a matter of distance as well. That is to say, at a distance, you will find a star exquisite and gorgeous because you gain perspective. In a close range, however, even a star may look ugly and grotesque. While explaining his own literary theory of distance, Jacques Derrida said that a woman may look more beautiful and mysterious at a distance. So does a man. If you are too close for comfort, you may find undesirable things and shortcomings of the person or thing you see. Telescopes and microscopes are the devices that reduce the distance between our eyes and the objects we want to see. When I lived in the States, I felt my vision, which had been 20/20, gradually deteriorating as I spent my days reading books in the university library. I went to a doctor??s office to get a pair of prescribed glasses. When I wore the glasses for the first time in my life, the whole world looked different. I could see everything so clearly. For example, I could see all the freckles on the nurse??s face. In a sense, the corrective lenses reduced the metaphorical distance between my eyes and the nurse.Likewise, even a beautiful twinkling, shiny star may not be pretty if you see it in a short range. Perhaps all you can find is a gigantic dark globe made of dust, merely reflecting light from the sun. A star is beautiful only when you dream of it or fantasize it at a distance. Reality and truth can be uncomfortable and ugly sometimes. Perhaps that is why we need poetry, fiction, songs, and dreams. Otherwise, life will be too gloomy, desolate, and bleak. In his monumental book, ??The Interpretation of Dreams,?? Freud argues that our dreams reflect our unconsciousness called ??Id?? that is formed by what has happened in the past. Despite Freud??s scientific explanations, many romantic people want to believe that dreams are prophesying our future or a wish-fulfillment. Indeed, the lyrics of a Christmas carol go, ??I??m dreaming of a white Christmas.?? We also say, ??My dream is to become a doctor,?? or ??You are my dream girl.?? At school, we teach our students to dream for a bright future. Indeed, we need to dream on, even though the reality is harsh and miserable. In that sense, our new government should implement committees on building a bright future, rather than on investigating the dark past. If we cling to the past, we will not be able to dream of the future. Besides, we do not have the luxury of spending time and energy digging out skeletons in the closet. Instead, we should unite and concentrate our time and energy on making a better future. You cannot change the past, but you can change the future. If we cannot get over past specters, we will not be able to move forward. Then our future will be as gloomy as our dark past was. The recent movie, ??Tomorrowland,?? implies that as long as there are dreamers on Earth, we can avoid total annihilation and have a bright future. At the end of the movie, dreamers in different countries find campaign pins inscribed with T, which stands for ??Tomorrowland.?? We, too, should strive to find our ??Tomorrowland.?? It would be unwise and miserable if we were helplessly lost in ??Pastland,?? while other nations found ??Tomorrowland?? already. If we are stuck in the dark past, all we can see will be the ugly mass of dust. If we move forward, we will surely see beautiful stars shining in the night sky. The choice is ours.By Kim Seong-konKim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and president of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea.

"496","Many faces of #MeToo",NA,"Korea Times",NA,NA,"January","Many faces of #MeToo  Korea Times January 2, 2018 Tuesday   Korea TimesJanuary 2, 2018 TuesdayMany faces of #MeTooBYLINE: By Hannah JunLENGTH: 581 wordsHannah JunSince 1927, TIME Magazine has devoted an annual issue to its Person of the Year. This distinction would go to the person who had the greatest influence ?? for better or worse ?? on events during the year. In 2016, this title went to U.S. President Donald Trump.This year, TIME honored 'the silence breakers' ?? individuals who spoke out against sexual harassment and assault and contributed to the broad social movement encapsulated by the #MeToo hashtag.In many ways, the #MeToo movement has focused on female victims and male perpetrators. Given that men have typically been in more powerful positions and have exerted disproportionate influence on most sectors of society, women have had few incentives to cry foul and faced little hope of getting justice.In this sense, understand (and agree with) the aim of empowering women to speak up against systematic exploitation.TIME cover ""The silence breakers"" / Screen captured from TIMEAt the same time, anyone can be a victim (or perpetrator) of sexual harassment or assault. In 2016, Korea's Saturday Night Live (SNL) program came under fire after footage surfaced of K-Pop boy groups B1A4, INFINITE and Block B being touched inappropriately by SNL's female crew members in an apparent hazing ritual.After joking in a message that the boy group members (in this case, B1A4) were not 'really' touched, SNL issued a formal apology on November 27, 2016 to its guests and fans regarding the 'inappropriate' incident.We have also seen similar cases in academia. In 2015, a female dance professor at Korea National University of Arts was fired after a disciplinary committee upheld male students' accusations of sexual harassment.According to the accusations, the professor made provocative comments towards the males and asked them to undress for class.This particular case suggests that power dynamics, rather than gender itself, may better explain why sexual harassment and assault take place.But while celebrities such as Amber of K-Pop girl group f(x) ?? who has also been the target of sexual harassment online by female users regarding her tomboyish image ?? have contributed to the local #MeToo movement, we have yet to see participation on a wide scale in Korea. For one, the risk of speaking out publicly is just too high. Korea is a closely-knit society where opportunities may be closed to perceived 'instigators.' In cases of male victims, data also suggests that men are less likely to speak out because they may be viewed as petty.But whether #MeToo as a social media movement takes off in Korea or not, we need to acknowledge the many faces of sexual harassment and assault and deal with them accordingly.At this point, I provide a word of caution. We live in a society that is now hypersensitive to accusations of sexual harassment and assault. While it is important to give those who were once powerless an avenue to speak up, the nature of social media and digitization has made cyber bullying ?? and even online defamation ?? possible.My hope is that #MeToo will be used as a starting point to help build awareness, and encourage better policy and systematic change. But to do this, I also suggest exercising prudence, a topic I will explore next time.Hannah Jun, Ph.D. (hannahjun@ewha.ac.kr) is director of the Center for Global Social Responsibility (CGSR) and professor of International Business at Ewha's Graduate School of International Studies, specializing in corporate sustainability and branding strategy.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: METOO MOVEMENT (91%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); SEXUAL HARASSMENT (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (86%); SOCIAL MEDIA (76%); STUDENT HAZING (76%); HAZING (76%); MEN (75%); DISMISSALS (75%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (72%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (71%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (68%); LATE NIGHT TELEVISION (67%); DANCE EDUCATION (63%)PERSON: DONALD TRUMP (57%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (94%); UNITED STATES (88%)LOAD-DATE: January 2, 2018Copyright 2018 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"
"497","[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security?",NA,"THE KOREA HERALD",NA,NA,"June","[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security?   THE KOREA HERALD June 5, 2017 Monday   THE KOREA HERALDJune 5, 2017 Monday[Herald Interview] ?North Korean human rights vital to regional security? LENGTH: 1056 wordsAs the world focuses on neutralizing North Korea??s nuclear and missile brinksmanship, equal attention should be given to grave human rights violations in the country, a former United Nations official said, stressing ??there can be no security without accountability.??For Michael Kirby, former chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People??s Republic of Korea, the issue has been close to his heart. He grew up in postwar Australia watching newsreels of Nazi concentration camps being opened up by Allied Forces. As he later listened to the escapees?? testimonies of horrors they experienced in North Korea??s detention camps, they brought back flashes of his earlier memories, he recalled. ??In the understandable concern about peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and region, don??t forget the obligations to human rights in North Korea,?? Kirby said in an interview with The Korea Herald arranged through the Australian Embassy in Seoul. ??It??s easy to focus undivided attention on that very serious issue of terrible weapons of mass destruction being developed there. But there will be no security whilst there is gross lack of human rights. Peace and security and universal human rights are both in the preamble to the UN Charter, and are both interrelated.??In the absence of protection and accountability, he added, the dream of peace and security in and around the peninsula remains illusory.Explaining why the two issues are critically inseparable, the 78-year-old former Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1996 to 2009 asserted that a country that does not respect basic rights of its citizens ??inherently creates a potentially explosive environment?? where people cannot live stably for a long period of time. As North Korea is a UN member, the international community has every right to insist that it conforms to the UN charter and treaties regarding human rights, most of which Pyongyang has ratified, according to Kirby. While advising the new administration of President Moon Jae-in to foster inter-Korean ties and offer humanitarian assistance, the Australian maintained that the conciliatory initiatives should not come at the price of advocating the end of heinous crimes in North Korea.Kirby drafted the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK in 2014, which was designed to investigate ??systemic, widespread and grave violations of human rights?? in the country. The report brought to light the regime??s denial of access to food, detention of people in prison camps, torture and inhumane treatment, discrimination, enforced disappearances, as well as violations of right to life and freedom of expression and movement. The document was delivered to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in 2014 and led to a resolution sponsored by the European Union and Japan, which was then passed at the General Assembly. It was eventually sent to the Security Council to consider referring the North Korean regime, including leader Kim Jong-un, to the International Criminal Court for prosecution for their crimes against humanity. The report remains on the standing agenda of the council awaiting a reference to the international court. It has been blocked by Russia and China for ??political reasons?? -- both with veto-wielding powers as the council??s permanent members.Most experts see the UN-led measure as a symbolic initiative to increase political pressure on Pyongyang to improve its human rights record. The council also urged Pyongyang to ensure ??full, rapid and unimpeded?? access of humanitarian assistance to the people and cooperate fully with the commission and the special rapporteur. ??In this report, we pointed out that the situation in North Korea is virtually unique in the entire world,?? Kirby emphasized, adding that although virtually all countries have problems of human rights to varying degrees, the ??intensity, variety and duration of violations in the North are so severe that they call out for actions by the international community.????After more than 70 years, it??s still a challenge for the world,?? he added. The document, written with testimonies of North Korean witnesses, reported that 120,000 men, women and children were forcibly detained in prison camps across the country and subject to torture, rape, abduction, forced labor and abortion, infanticide, summary execution and starvation. Responding to some arguments that the world should not stir up the debate for the sake of enhancing political ties, Kirby countered by saying ??there is no evidence that North Korea responds to gentleness or sweetness of diplomacy.????Only after the commission published the report did the regime finally begin to take the issue very seriously,?? he continued, saying Pyongyang engaged in what he called the ??charm offensive?? of releasing three detained US citizens and declaring that it is open to nuclear and reunification talks. On the possibility of having to offer impunity to offenders for moving forward a prospective mechanism of transitional justice, as happened in Colombia with guerilla organization FARC, the retired Australian judge said ??crimes against humanity is a special species that demands accountability.?? He also underscored that the UN had ??never traded human rights for security interests.??Kirby expressed his support for strengthening North Korea??s economy, but elucidated that human rights is ??the other side of the coin of economic development?? and demands for improvement should not be pigeonholed. ??I agree with the argument (of supporting the North??s economic development) insofar as the country??s isolation is a serious impediment to its development, and that in turn makes it difficult to secure the necessary human rights levels,?? he explained. ??North Korea has enormous potential with minerals and other natural resources, but it??s cut off from the rest of the world and spending all its energy and capacity on nuclear development. It has thereby deliberately chosen a course of isolation and impoverishment.??As a practical solution, the Australian suggested restarting the six-party talks or forging some other form of a diplomatic mechanism, such as a peace treaty with North Korea. Such options have been outlined in the report, he said.By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.com)LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); HUMAN RIGHTS & CIVIL LIBERTIES LAW (89%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (78%); INTERNATIONAL COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (73%); FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (73%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (72%); VIOLENT CRIME (72%); EUROPEAN UNION (66%); SUPREME COURTS (64%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (64%)PERSON: KIM JONG UN (58%); MOON JAE-IN (58%)CITY: PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (94%); NORTHERN ASIA (94%); SWITZERLAND (79%); EUROPE (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (79%)LOAD-DATE: June 6, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Kim Jong-gil was his pen name. His mother died when he was only two years old.In his early childhood, he was cared for by his father and grandmother and especially his great-grandfather, who was a noted scholar of the old Confucian tradition. He began to learn Chinese characters from his great-grandfather almost before he could walk. He studied at a teachers' training school in Daegu and from 1940, for several years, he helped edit a literary coterie magazine there. In 1945, after the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, he entered the humanities section of Hyehwa College (Hyehwa Jeonmun Hakgyo) in Seoul. There he formed a literary club with other students, which began to produce its own magazine.Having begun to write poems, he won the 1947 Spring Literary Award of the Kyunghyang Sinmun, marking the start of his official career as a published poet. In the spring of the same year, he transferred schools and entered the English department of Korea University.There he came under the influence of Professor Lee In-su, the first Korean to have graduated in English literature from the University of London, a gifted translator who introduced him to T. S. Eliot's 'Wasteland.' He graduated in 1950 and during the Korean War (1950-53) he served as an interpreter. From 1953 he taught at Daegu Technical High School and also lectured at the College of Education of Gyeongbok University. In 1954 he was appointed as full-time lecturer at Gyeongbok University and in the same year published a volume of translations of 20th century English poetry. He became assistant professor in the Department of English Language and Literature at Korea University in 1958.In 1960 he was able to go to England, where he spent a year studying at Sheffield University under the guidance of the celebrated critic William Empson. During this time he met T. S. Eliot and other well-known writers and critics. Returning to Korea University, he continued his academic career. In 1969 he published his first collection of poems, 'Christmas.' In the autumn that year he visited the United States, where he met celebrated poets including Robert Lowell.In the following years he lectured, published critical studies and served for several years as the university librarian. In 1983 he paid another visit to England, where he met noted literary critics including Christopher Ricks and A. Alvarez. In the following year he was able to spend a year studying at the University of Cambridge. In 1986 he celebrated his 60th birthday by publishing a volume of prose writings, a survey of modern English-language poetry, a second collection of his own poems, 'Yellow Dust,' and a volume of poetic theory.Throughout his career, he translated a considerable number of contemporary poems by Korean poets, into English. These translations were published in various Korean journals but were never published as a separate collection. In 1987 Anvil Press (London) published a volume of his English translations of Korean classical Chinese poetry, 'Slow Chrysanthemums.'In 1988 he became President of the Korean Poets' Association. He participated in several international gatherings and met Seamus Heaney in Kyoto in 1990. In 1991 a volume of his selected poems was published, followed by a collection of his English-language literary essays, 'The Darling Buds of May.'He retired from Korea University in 1992, after which he was free to travel and give papers at various international conferences around the world. In 1993 he was elected a member of the Korean Academy of Arts. He was given the Inchon Award in 1996. His third collection of poems, 'An Evening Primrose,' appeared in 1997 and in 1998 he received the Korean government's Silver Order of Merit for Culture.In 2000 his English translations of the poems of Kim Chun-su were published in the United States. In 2003 a volume of German translations of a selection of his poems was published in Germany. In 2005 he received the Gosan Literary Award. In 2008 he published another collection of poems, 'Gleaning at Dusk,' and a Spanish translation of some of his poems appeared in Mexico. In 2009 he published a collection of essays about his encounters with celebrated international writers and also received the Manhae Award. In 2011 he published the poetry collection 'Those Things' and in 2013 he published a volume of his selected poems, 'The Kite,' which is soon to be published in English, too late for him to see it.Kim Jong-gil often explained that the pressure of his work as an academic meant that he had very little time to write his own poetry. This year marks the 70th anniversary of his recognition as a poet. He was a living archive of the history of 20th-century poetry and will be sorely missed.LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: LITERATURE (91%); DEATH & DYING (90%); POETRY (90%); WRITERS (90%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (90%); LITERARY CRITICISM (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (88%); LIBRARIANS (78%); CELEBRITIES (78%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (75%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (75%); HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (75%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (75%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (75%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (74%); HIGH SCHOOLS (74%); TEACHER EDUCATION (74%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (74%); MAGAZINE PUBLISHING (73%); KOREAN WAR (73%); ACADEMIC LIBRARIES (72%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (72%); CHRISTMAS (70%); ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS (66%)CITY: LONDON, ENGLAND (79%); SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); TAEGU, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (57%)COUNTRY: NORTHERN ASIA (96%); KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%); JAPAN (79%); KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF (79%); ENGLAND (69%); UNITED STATES (68%)LOAD-DATE: April 2, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea TimesAll Rights Reserved"

The court has up to June to give its ruling.Growing weary of the corruption scandal engulfing the nation's political, business, legal, culture and sports circles, many Koreans seem determined to continue their fight to reform the flawed systems and make a fairer society even after Park's ouster from office.ã€€'Candle revolution'ã€€The first anti-Park candlelight vigil in late October was relatively small, with about 20,000 participants, but grew week after week in turnout amid emerging allegations implicating President Park in the scandal and her refusal to step down.The sixth rally on Dec. 3 drew as many as 2.32 million people, surpassing the number of protestors during pro-democracy movements in the 1980s and making it the largest in the nation's history.""The past rallies have been led and dominated by specific groups, but this time, the majority of protestors were unaffiliated citizens who voluntarily chose to participate out of anger toward the president,"" sociology professor Lee Byung-hoon at Chung-Ang University told The Korea Herald.""South Koreans have taken to the streets in a peaceful and mature manner, with the festive rallies becoming a platform to express various opinions,"" he said.Despite the large number of participants, the rallies were devoid of violent clashes or arrests for unlawful activities. The ways of delivering messages also diversified, with many ridiculing the president and her friends with satirical signs and performances.ã€€'Candles will not be blown out'ã€€But what the majority of South Koreans desperately want is not only the impeachment of the embattled president, but also a society governed by democratic values of fairness, law and order.That's why people will likely continue to take to the streets this year, experts said.""Social media made it possible for citizens to take to the streets in an unprecedentedly large scale,"" said Kim Seo-joong, professor for journalism and broadcasting at SungKongHoe University. ""Citizens will continue to criticize politicians through the platform and mobilize themselves.""(Yonhap)""To complement the representative democracy, however, there should be further talks on how to keep the political system and political elites, often attempting to maximize their self-interests, in check,"" he said. ""That's what I think the candlelight movement will bring this year.""The sociology professor Lee, however, said the scale of the candlelight vigils will depend on how the political and economic situation unfold this year.""While it is difficult to predict the candlelight movement's future course of action, the continued economic slump, the Constitutional Court's decision on Park's impeachment and major changes in the political arena, including a breakup of the ruling Saenuri Party, will all likely affect how it plays out,"" Lee said.Lee Nae-young, politics professor at Korea University, pointed out limitations of street rallies.""The long-lasting candlelight vigils have been possible due to a broad agreement to demand President Park's resignation,"" said Lee. ""As the candlelight vigils successfully pushed the parliament to impeach the president now, the rally participants' demands will begin to further diversify.""Despite the protestors' continued calls for President Park's ouster, there were growing policy-related calls for scrapping state-authored history books, labor market reform plans and the US' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system, among others.Some citizens frowned upon labor unionists' demand for the release of Han Sang-kyun, chief of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, who is standing trial on charges of leading ""illegal"" rallies. The demand for cancellation of a court ruling, which led to dissolution of the minor opposition Unified Progressive Party for the alleged pursuit of North Korean ideology, also drew criticism.""With the growing movement against the impeachment of Park, conflicts in civil society will reach a peak in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election,"" he said. ""It is time for the parliament to take a lead in framing political agendas and reflect the people's voices in the policymaking process.""ã€€Rise of participatory democracyã€€""I don't think my protest will change things immediately. But it is a way of pressuring lawmakers to represent us and teaching them we are angry,"" said Park Se-jin, a 30-year-old artist who has joined the Saturday's rallies for the past two months.""I've had enough with lawmakers who do not care about citizens. The scandal made me take more interest in politics and carefully cast my ballot in the upcoming presidential election.""Such sentiments are reflected in the emerging grassroots movement, an attempt to make their voices heard in the long term in the political realm.The rally organizers formed a Citizens' Council in a bid to carry forward the momentum in the candlelight vigils and turn it into a long-term discussion to map out plans to fix the nation.""It is a forum to collect a variety of ideas in their neighborhoods, understand clashing viewpoints and draw solutions for problems facing the society,"" said Choi Hyun-mo, one of the organizers.The rally organizers -- an association of 1,500 civic groups and labor unions -- plan to stage rallies until the Constitutional Court approves the impeachment.""I believe that the strong elements of direct democracy we are trying to embrace here will gradually complement the representative political system to achieve a democracy working for all.""By Ock Hyun-ju (LANGUAGE: ENGLISHPUBLICATION-TYPE: NewspaperSUBJECT: NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (91%); DEMOCRACIES (90%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (90%); HISTORY (89%); SCANDALS (89%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (89%); POLITICAL SCANDALS (78%); CORRUPTION (78%); HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); EXTORTION (76%); DECISIONS & RULINGS (74%); SETTLEMENTS & DECISIONS (74%); LITIGATION (73%); SOCIOLOGY (66%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)PERSON: PARK GEUN-HYE (93%)CITY: SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (79%)COUNTRY: KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (95%); NORTHERN ASIA (93%)LOAD-DATE: January 4, 2017Copyright 2017 The Korea HeraldAll Rights Reserved"

Despite his support, it took more than a decade to finally be able to call South Korea her home.From the language barrier and spicy food to the country's patriarchal values, the 47-year-old, who did not want to use her real name, faced challenges every step of the way to adjust to life here, some 2,600 kilometers away from her family and friends in the Philippines.(Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)""As I started to live with my husband's family, I found it difficult to prepare food on traditional holidays and for Confucian ancestral rites. Unlike men in my home country, Korean men didn't give a helping hand in cooking or washing dishes,"" Maria said in an interview with The Korea Herald. ""I could not even cope with Korean food, so I lived on eggs.""""The most difficult thing is, of course, loneliness. I could not speak the language. I had no friends. There were not many Filipina wives back in 2000,"" said Maria, who lives with her husband and two children in northern Seoul.Her personal experience led her to apply for a job at Danuri Helpline -- a hotline mostly for foreign wives married to Korean men -- in 2006. She is one of the 99 counsellors at the hotline operated by the Korean Institute for Healthy Family.The hotline provides translation and counselling services, and information on things ranging from Korean language programs and job opportunities to visas and government support. It also provides emergency aid and shelters for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.The counsellors at the state-run agency are foreign-born wives who have lived in South Korea for more than three years. They take calls from women from their countries of origin and offer services in 13 languages including Chinese, Vietnamese and English.(Ministry of Gender Equality and Family)According to data from the Interior Ministry, the number of foreign-born spouses stood at 238,161 in 2015. The biggest group were ethnic Koreans with Chinese nationality, followed by Chinese, Vietnam, Filipinos, Japanese and Cambodians, the data showed.Maria, who has offered services in Tagalog and English for 12 years now, said that she takes all kinds of calls.Some ask for simple translations between Korean and their languages. Others seek information on what to do in response to the outbreak of a contagious disease, earthquake and North Korea's launch of missiles into East Sea.
